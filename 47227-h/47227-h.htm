<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Dr. W. M. HAFFKINE.</span><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTOR-IN-CHIEF, GOVERNMENT PLAGUE RESEARCH LABORATORY, BOMBAY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was due to certain particularly favorable circumstances that the
first ideas on preventive inoculation were gathered from observations
on smallpox patients. Such circumstances were presumably the
following:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> It is a disease which attacks epidemically, in a short time and
within a small area, large numbers of people, thus permitting of
easy comparisons and suggesting conclusions from the facts observed.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Its fatality is comparatively small, so that after each outbreak a
large number of convalescent persons remain alive to serve as objects
for future observation and comparison.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> These convalescents are marked and are thus easily distinguishable
from the rest of the population who have not been attacked, and
even the severity of the disease they have gone through is, so to say,
written down on their faces and bodies.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The disease is easily communicable, owing to the infectious
matter appearing on the surface of the patient’s body in the pustules.</p>

<p>It was easy, therefore, to notice in this case, as was indeed very early
done in the East, that a person who has gone through one attack, as
shown by his pitted face, very rarely suffers even during severe subsequent
epidemics. Smallpox, like other epidemic diseases, breaks out in
some years in very fatal, in others in milder forms. It is admissible that
by a mixed process of thought and faith an impression insensibly gained
ground that it was <i>lucky</i> to have been touched by the smallpox deity&mdash;of
course, not in years when that deity appeared in terrifying mortality.
Accordingly, in times of <i>mild</i> outbreaks people would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
very careful in avoiding infected persons, and would even seek their
company so as to get infected from them. The practice of intentionally
rubbing one’s skin with a pustule, or with bits of it, from an attacked
person, must have been a subsequent stage.</p>

<p>Such or a similarly gradual development of ideas may explain why
it is impossible to fix a date or place for this discovery, which indeed
goes back to the darkness of antiquity. Research points to its practice
among the Chinese and Hindus in very ancient times. The Chinamen
induced a mild attack by inserting a crust from a smallpox pustule into
the nostrils. The Hindus, on the contrary, used the fluid pus, which
they inoculated under the skin of the arm. In either case, in the course
of a week, the inoculated was attacked by some slight preliminary
symptoms followed by an eruption, sometimes profuse, sometimes
scanty, and then the disease would run its ordinary course. The only
difference between an attack caused by inoculation and that caused
by natural infection was, as a rule, the milder nature of the former,
especially when the matter for inoculation was taken from a notoriously
mild case. The result, however, was by no means certain. A mild
form of an infectious disease may be due either to the virus being
of a weak nature; and then such a virus would be the
desired one for inoculating persons seeking artificial protection; or
else the mildness of the case may be due to the patient himself being
of a resistant organization, in which case, though exhibiting mild
symptoms himself, he may be harboring an intense form of contagion,
apt to cause a severe outbreak when transferred to other less resistant
persons. Many plans were consequently adopted to secure with more
certainty a mild artificial infection. Some of these were directed to
the treatment of the patient preparatory to inoculation, others to the
preparation of the infectious matter in order to attenuate its virulence.
The Brahmans, who were the operators in India, in addition to selecting
material from patients with a mild form of the disease, were accustomed
not to employ the pus at once, but to keep it wrapped up in
cotton wool for a period of about twelve months, and thus to weaken
its power. They inoculated in the early part of the year, at the time
when smallpox prevailed, and the practice they used was to moisten
with water a bit of cotton wool prepared in the previous outbreak, to
place it on the arm of the person to be inoculated, and to prick the arm,
through the wool, over an area of about the size of a twenty-five cent
piece. In a few days a vesicle would appear at the seat of the inoculation,
which later on developed into a pustule and eruption. Notwithstanding
these precautions, great variation in the results was observed,
and many succumbed to the operation; but those that passed through it
safely were proof against further attacks.</p>

<p>Besides the personal risk to the inoculated, the illness produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
in them was infectious to others, and unprotected persons coming in
contact with the inoculated were likely to get infected from them. The
latter result was largely avoided by the practice adopted by the Brahmans
of inoculating all the inhabitants of a family or village at the
same time. The benefits secured under the above precautions were
considered far to outweigh the risks of inoculation.</p>

<p>With the extension of smallpox westward the system of artificial
protection spread toward Europe through the intermediary of travelers
and merchants. The Arabs and Turks appreciated its benefits at an
early date. The slave dealers supplying the bazaars and harems
of Constantinople adopted the system to protect against disfigurement
their Circassian and other live stock. In the early part of the eighteenth
century the method was made known to the English practitioners
by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the English ambassador at
Constantinople, who had her two children inoculated according to the
Turkish system. Curiously enough, it was soon afterward discovered
that a similar method was in practice among the peasants of some of
the districts in Wales and the Highlands of Scotland, and had long
been known there as ‘buying the smallpox.’ When inoculation was
given a more extensive trial it was found, in England as in the East,
that the effect of it was decidedly beneficial, but fraught with danger.
At first one in every fifty of those operated upon succumbed to the
consequences of inoculation. By improved methods the mortality was
gradually reduced to one in a thousand; but the most serious danger lay
in the spread of infection to healthy persons. The precaution of inoculating
whole groups of inhabitants at one time, or of keeping the inoculated
apart from the healthy, as had been practiced by the Brahmans
ages ago, was overlooked, and the result was often disastrous to the
community.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was at this time that Jenner achieved great progress and threw
a vast amount of new light on the question. As is well known, he
started from a belief that existed in the west of England, that cowpox
was a bovine form of smallpox, and that the milkers who attended on
cows suffering from that disease and who became infected with the
eruptions on the teats and udders, passed through a mild illness, which
rendered them immune against smallpox. Jenner determined to put
this tradition to the test, and succeeded in establishing, by a few accurate
and well-planned experiments, a series of most important facts.</p>

<p>He showed, first, that cowpox could be artificially given to the
cow by infecting it with virus from a smallpox patient, and that the
disease thus produced was transferable by inoculation from cow to cow.</p>

<p>He showed further, that by having been bred in the tissues of the
cow, the virus lost its intense infective properties for man. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the matter from an artificially infected animal was transferred by inoculation
to a human being, it produced at the seat of its insertion
a discrete vesicle, which was not followed by a general eruption, as
would often be the case with the original smallpox virus.</p>

<p>Though the illness thus induced was not infectious in the sense that
it would not be communicated spontaneously from person to person,
it could be so transferred artificially by inoculating patients with the
lymph from a ripe human vesicle.</p>

<p>When transferred from cow to cow or from man to man the matter
preserved unchanged the same property of producing the mild inoculation
vesicle, harmless to the patient and to his surroundings; and
thus a matter for inoculation was obtained of <i>invariable strength</i>, what
was called later on, by Pasteur, ‘virus fixe.’</p>

<p>The last and the most essential property which Jenner demonstrated
to belong to the substance in question was the following: A man who
had been inoculated with that substance could afterward be with impunity
infected with a virus taken direct from a smallpox patient; the
inoculation would be either abortive altogether or the effect much
milder than in a man not so prepared. Jenner concluded from this
most striking result that the inoculation with the matter cultivated by
him in the cow would protect a man forever against contamination with
smallpox, and he called that matter ‘vaccine,’ or cow lymph.</p>

<p>Jenner’s experiments produced an immense impression throughout
the world, and inoculation according to his system, which was called
‘vaccination,’ was rapidly applied to large numbers of people. When
outbreaks of smallpox occurred in the midst of vaccinated communities,
observations began to come in as to the actual effectiveness of the
method in protecting against the disease.</p>

<p>These observations proved that the system possessed an undoubted
and exceedingly high beneficial effect, though the following two restrictions
had to be imposed upon the originally conceived expectations:</p>

<p>1. The protection was not absolute. In every outbreak of smallpox
a number of patients were and are met with who are attacked, generally
mildly, but also in some cases fatally, though they had undergone a
successful vaccination, some even at a comparatively recent date before
the attack. Only the proportion of such patients to the whole of the
vaccinated community is very markedly smaller than the proportion
of attacks in the non-vaccinated; and also the severity of the attack, as
well as the proportion of deaths to attacks, is in the vaccinated much
smaller.</p>

<p>2. This favorable difference between the outbreaks among vaccinated
and non-vaccinated is maintained not for life, but for a limited
number of years, and disappears gradually, and at length altogether,
unless the individuals be revaccinated. Observation has shown that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
period during which the protective effect of vaccination lasts extends
over from three to seven years.</p>

<p>Vaccination very rapidly displaced inoculation, and spread to every
part of the civilized world. The results have been dwelt upon in
innumerable books and pamphlets. At present great outbreaks of
smallpox have become very rare, at least in the civilized part of the
world, and there is a tendency to forget or ignore the devastations they
used to cause.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The first successful attempt in extending the system of inoculation
to other diseases was made only after the discovery of the fact that
‘infection’ is caused by living animal or vegetable parasites, capable in
the majority of cases of being cultivated and bred in artificial media
outside the animal body. Pasteur found that he was able to effect protection
against disease similar to vaccination against smallpox by the
use of such artificially bred micro-organisms.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to relate that this important discovery was
made unintentionally, and represents one of those happy ‘accidents’
which occur to those who diligently search. Pasteur had been working
with cultures of chicken-cholera microbes, an extremely fatal form
of virus when it is introduced into fowls and small birds. It so happened
that one of his cultures was left forgotten in the incubator
when work was stopped for the vacation. On the return of Pasteur and
his assistants the experiments were continued. When the bottle was
discovered, thinking that the microbes might have been exhausted
or dead from long starvation, Pasteur tried to make what is called a
fresh culture of them, by inseminating a sample from the old bottle into
a freshly prepared nutritious broth. The microbes were not dead, and
multiplied and grew luxuriantly; but when they were injected into a
fowl they caused only a transient and non-fatal disease. To make a
fresh start, Pasteur took some old blood, which he had drawn a
long time previously from a chicken-cholera fowl and preserved in a
cupboard in the laboratory in a sealed-up tube, and made a culture with
the material that was in that tube. The culture thus obtained killed
fresh fowls as usual, but when it was injected into the bird that had
resisted the first culture it resisted this injection also. Pasteur, who
excelled all men I ever knew in his ability of quickly analyzing and
discerning true connections between facts, required no further hints.
Others might perhaps have dwelt on the peculiarity of the fowl that
happened to resist the injections, or on some other circumstances.
Pasteur relinquished this and other suggestions at once, and thought
of the microbe. The fact that old specimens of microbes may
become impotent when injected into animals was known to him,
and was readily explained by the vitality of such microbes being lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
or exhausted by starvation. But, then, such a microbe when transferred
into a fresh medium, if not dead, generally regains its vigor, and
after that, when inoculated into an animal, it produces its usual effect.
The remarkable circumstance about the culture left in the incubator
was that even when it was transferred into a fresh medium and its
vitality renewed, it remained still impotent. Pasteur concluded from
this that an infectious microbe possesses two distinct properties: one,
which it shares with any other living being&mdash;viz., <i>vitality</i>&mdash;which may
be weakened or strengthened according to the conditions of life and
food; and another, which he considered as its ‘virulence,’ its power of
causing diseases, which may be also weakened or strengthened by special
means, but which is quite independent of ‘vitality.’</p>

<p>The lucidity of thought of which Pasteur made proof on this occasion
was magnificent. Later researches confirmed and explained these
facts with a singular completeness, and now the idea, as is always the
case, looks simple and self-evident. One must remember that at that
time Pasteur had every reason to believe that disease is caused by the
mere fact of a foreign micro-organism of a given species penetrating and
settling down to live in the system of a man or animal. Its capability
of <i>living</i> there, <i>i. e.</i>, its vital properties, seemed all that was necessary
for causing disease. It was only later that it was found that pathogenic
microbes cause diseases by producing so-called toxines or poisonous
substances distinct from their own bodies and separable from them.
The process may be illustrated by a comparison, for instance, with a
cobra or any other animal producing a special venom. By starvation
or some other treatment the vitality of the cobra may be temporarily
weakened. When it obtains fresh food again and gets generally in good
condition, it recovers, without its ability of producing venom having
been in any way impaired. On the other hand, a snake may be by an
operation deprived of its fangs and power of secreting poison without
its health and strength being in the least affected. Pasteur at once
asserted that in a similar way it was possible by starvation to weaken a
breed of microbes without their virulence being diminished, and, on the
other hand, to deprive them of their power of producing disease without
impairing their vitality, though what the above power consisted in he
did not know. He called the latter result <i>attenuation</i> of a virus. An
attenuated virus in his meaning is therefore a special breed of pathogenic
microbes which can be maintained, by suitable breeding, in best
conditions of health, but which has lost either partially or entirely its
power of producing poison and disease.</p>

<p>Pasteur extracted from the few experiments related above a further
most-important conclusion&mdash;viz., that such an attenuation was due to
and could be produced artificially by the effect of oxidation. This he
deduced from the fact that the microbes in the sealed-up tube had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
lost their virulence, while those forgotten in the open bottle in the
incubator and exposed to the access of air had done so. Oxidation
proved indeed to be one of the most general methods of artificially producing
attenuated virus, to which method later on were added others&mdash;the
effect of light, of chemicals, of passage through certain animals, etc.</p>

<p>And, of course, the last and crowning conclusion was that an ordinary,
susceptible fowl that has undergone the injection with an attenuated
culture becomes immune against a culture which kills other
fowls; and that conclusion, in the particular circumstances under which
Pasteur was working, proved to be true.</p>

<p>Pursuing the new line of research, Pasteur demonstrated that a
protection similar to that obtained against smallpox and chicken cholera
could be secured also against <i>anthrax</i>, a disease which, by the destruction
it caused among sheep and cattle, was entailing heavy loss on the
farmers of France. After a long series of experiments he prepared
two specimens of virus, different in strength, but both weaker than the
natural contagion, and worked out the proportions in which sheep,
horses and cows could be safely injected first with the weakest virus and
then with the virus of the somewhat greater strength, after which
they became capable of withstanding the strongest anthrax infection.</p>

<p>In honor of Jenner, who was the first to discover the way of preparing
a virus of a fixed strength safe to be used for the preventive
treatment of men, Pasteur proposed that all such artificially bred, so
to say, domesticated forms of microbes be called <i>vaccines</i>, while the
word <i>virus</i> be reserved for a contagion growing in nature in a natural
condition, or taken direct from an infected individual. The French
distinguish between ‘vaccin,’ which is used as a generic term in
Pasteur’s sense, and ‘vaccine,’ which name they reserve for smallpox
vaccinia lymph. The word ‘vaccination’ has been also extended to designate
inoculation with artificially vaccinized virus, while the word ‘inoculation’
is used for the injection of a natural, not vaccinated virus,
taken direct from a patient. The latter distinction is, however, not
yet strictly maintained in English literature, nor in the subsequent
pages of this paper.</p>

<p>Pasteur gave a memorable demonstration of the efficiency of his
method of anthrax vaccination. At Pouilly-le-Fort, in the midst
of an assemblage of scientists, delegates of agricultural societies, government
officials, landlords, farmers and representatives of the press,
he performed the following experiment: Sixty sheep were taken; ten of
these were put aside, twenty-five were vaccinated with the two attenuated
anthrax vaccines at an interval of twelve days, and twenty-five
were left untouched. Twelve days afterward the two groups of twenty-five
sheep were inoculated with virulent anthrax; and the result was
that at the next visit the twenty-five unvaccinated and one vaccinated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
pregnant female were found dead, while twenty-four out of the twenty-five
that had been vaccinated were perfectly well, and exhibited during
the whole time they were kept under observation the same degree of
health as the ten sheep that had been put aside for comparison.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>An impetus was given by these discoveries to researches having for
their object the protection of <i>men</i> against infectious diseases. The
most important of these researches was Pasteur’s own into the nature
of hydrophobia and rabies, and the way of inoculating against that
disease. This was followed a few years later by the preparation of a
prophylactic against cholera.</p>

<p>Inoculation against hydrophobia was rendered possible by the discovery
of the fact that the rabies or hydrophobia virus is found in
a pure condition, free from other microbes, in the nervous centers of
animals. The material for inoculation is prepared from such nervous
matter, the virulence of which is rendered <i>fixe</i>, as will be mentioned
below.</p>

<p>The cholera microbe, which was subsequently named <i>comma bacillus</i>,
was discovered by Koch in 1883, in the intestinal contents of cholera
patients. Two years later cholera broke out in Spain, and Dr. James
Ferran, a Spanish physician, began inoculating men with living cultures
of comma bacillus taken from patients attacked with the disease. The
procedure in its essential features corresponded to the pre-Jenner
method of inoculation. The failure to fix the strength of the virus
used for treatment rendered the method subject to the same uncertainty
as that which was connected with inoculation with smallpox
virus taken direct from patients. It was impossible to predict the
effect of the injections. Comma bacilli taken from cholera patients
may, under cultivation, show themselves extremely virulent, or, on the
contrary, extremely mild. There are specimens which, when injected
into a Guinea pig, even in an insignificant dose, will prove fatal to it,
and there are others which will appear harmless when given in a dose
seventy times greater. The immediate effect, and the protection caused
by the inoculation, must, of course, vary accordingly. The attempt
made by Ferran caused great interest, and a number of scientific commissions
were sent to Spain from different countries of Europe to
study the results of his work. They could, however, come to no conclusion,
and the treatment speedily lost its position. Only some seven
years later a method was found of fixing the strength of the cholera
virus. I was connected with this stage of the work, and it may perhaps
present some interest to the reader to relate the way in which
the problem was solved, and to show how gradual is the development
of ideas by which results in laboratory investigation are arrived at.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned already that the virulence of microbes changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
under the influence of different agents in Nature&mdash;heat, light, chemicals.
When a virus is first obtained from a patient or outside a patient
its preceding history, its antecedents, the conditions under which it
lived before, are extremely variable. Jenner’s method of cultivating
the smallpox virus by transferring it from calf to calf secured for that
virus uniform conditions of life, and its strength could thus be maintained
unchanged for an indefinite length of time. Pasteur, in the
preparation of hydrophobia vaccine, followed the same plan, and found
in the successive inoculation from rabbit to rabbit a method of propagating
the hydrophobia virus in a uniform condition. But attempts
made to cultivate in a similar way the comma bacillus by transferring it
from animal to animal failed.</p>

<p>The most susceptible animals for the cholera microbe are Guinea
pigs. There are two principal methods of ingrafting upon them the
virus: Koch’s method of administering it through the mouth and
leaving it to develop in the intestines of the animal, and Pfeiffer’s of
injecting it, not into the intestines, but into the abdominal or peritoneal
cavity, where the intestines are lodged, by introducing there the
virus with a hypodermic needle not allowed to penetrate into the intestines
themselves. But by neither of these methods could the microbe
be cultivated in an unbroken series of animals, as it became gradually
weakened and soon lost its power of affecting such animals. For the
purpose in question, cultivation in the peritoneal cavity had the advantage
that in a healthy individual the peritoneum is free from other
microbes, whereas in the intestines there are always present a large
number of micro-organisms which interfere in variable ways with the
growth of the particular microbes.</p>

<p>But when one inoculates the peritoneal cavity of a Guinea pig
with a dose of cholera microbes sufficient to cause a fatal disease,
it is found, when the animal dies, that the microbes have died
also. Thus, the attempt to ingraft the virus from a first animal to a
subsequent one is checked at the very beginning. This initial difficulty
was overcome by merely giving to the first animal a dose larger
than was necessary to cause a fatal effect. The animal then succumbs
more rapidly, and the microbes have no time to disappear. At
the post-mortem examination there is found, in the peritoneal cavity, a
small amount of exudate liquid which contains large numbers of those
microbes alive. When, however, that exudate is injected into the peritoneal
cavity of a second animal that animal does not succumb to the
infection, or even if it succumbs one finds that the microbes have again
disappeared in this second animal. By starting with, a still larger
initial dose one may have three, perhaps four, successive animals affected
by the virus, but it invariably ends by being weakened, and finally
dies out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
In trying to obviate this result I found, perhaps contrary
to expectations, that the exudation liquid should be exposed to the air
for a few hours before it is injected into a subsequent animal. This
result was contradictory to the effect which Pasteur had found to be
exercised by atmospheric oxygen on the virulence of microbes, and it
requires at least some provisional explanation. The microbes of cholera
differ from a certain number of other microbes in that they stand in
need of a free and abundant access of air for growing and multiplying
quite satisfactorily. They are deprived of this condition in the peritoneal
cavity of an animal. It is possible, therefore, that a certain
opposition between the maintenance or development of virulence on the
one hand, and a lowering in vitality on the other, takes place while
they are cultivated there, and a respite must be given them between
each successive ‘passage’ through the Guinea pig by leaving them for
a time in the free atmosphere. Be that explanation true or not, the
result is that under such conditions the successive animals inoculated
with the virus do succumb, and even in a shorter and shorter time, after
the inoculation, the microbe apparently undergoing under such a treatment
a progressive increase in virulence. A similar development up to a
certain stage was observed by Pasteur when transferring the rabies
virus from rabbit to rabbit. The last difficulty that presented itself was
the following: The exudation liquid which is found in the peritoneal
cavity post mortem varies in quantity; sometimes it is inconveniently
large and diluted; sometimes, on the contrary, so scanty that it becomes
difficult to collect and transfer it to another animal. I found that this
variation stands in connection with the size of the animal, so that a
diluted exudation fluid can be concentrated by injecting it into a small
animal, while a too much concentrated exudate is rendered more dilute
by transferring it to an animal of a larger size.</p>

<p>Thus, by the initial use of more than a fatal dose, by alternating
cultivation in an animal with exposure to air, and by attention to the
size of the animal employed, a material was obtained which, as mentioned,
increased in intensity from the first and proved fatal to animals
in a shorter and shorter time after inoculation. Later the virus reached
a stage when it killed a Guinea pig of three hundred and fifty
grammes weight in eight hours. After that, in each further inoculation
the time of eight hours remained stationary, showing that the virus
has reached the condition of a ‘virus fixe.’ These experiments were
conducted by me in the Pasteur Institute, in 1889 to 1893, simultaneously
on the cholera microbe and on the bacillus of typhoid. The two
exhibited a number of common features in their nature, and the results
as above detailed for the cholera microbe were found valid for the
typhoid bacillus also.</p>

<p>Starting from the ‘virus fixe’ obtained as above, a method of double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
inoculation was worked out, one with an attenuated virus prepared
from the ‘virus fixe,’ and another with the latter itself. The two
‘vaccines,’ when inoculated successively into Guinea pigs, protected
them against all possible forms of cholera infection. The vaccines
were cultivated on a solid medium, and when the crop of microbes was
ready at the end of some twenty-four hours, they were washed off the
surface of the medium and used as a kind of medicinal plant. It was
found that the substances contained in the microbes preserved to a
great extent their immunizing properties even when the microbes were
killed by some delicate processes not affecting considerably their chemical
constitution. The washings could, therefore, be prepared in dilute
solutions of carbolic acid, and employed in the form of preserved vaccines.
In 1892 and in the beginning of 1893 I made a series of experiments
in Paris, in Netley, in London, in Cambridge, and in Calcutta,
with these carbolized cholera vaccines, which had been preserved in
sealed tubes for a period of six to seven months, and it was possible to
show the protective effect of the method on animals as conclusively as
Pasteur had done in the demonstration at Pouilly-le-Fort with anthrax.
For the inoculation in man, however, I decided to use at first only unaltered
living vaccines, as much more promising than the dead ones,
especially from the point of view of the durability of the effect.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Abstract from an article in the Quarterly Review discussing Professor Ewart’s ‘Experimental
Investigations on Telegony,’ read before the Royal Society last year, and his book,
‘The Penycuik Experiments,’ published by Messrs. A. &amp; D. Black.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> views and works of Darwin have influenced in an unexpected
way the nature of the work carried on by biological investigators
during the latter end of this fast-dying century. To a great extent,
while generally holding the doctrines he held, they have forsaken his
methods of inquiry.</p>

<p>If animals and plants have arrived at their present state by descent
with modification from simpler forms, it ought to be possible by careful
searching to trace the line of ancestry; and it is this fascinating but
frequently futile pursuit which has dominated the minds of many of
our ablest zoölogists for the last thirty years. To such an extent has this
pedigree hunting been carried that there is scarcely a group of invertebrates
from which the vertebrates have not been theoretically derived;
and to-day one of the ablest of our physiologists is using his great
powers in the attempt to trace the origin of the backboned animals from
a spiderlike creature, and is exercising his ingenuity in a plausible but
unconvincing effort to equate the organs of a king-crab with those of a
lamprey. This appeal to comparative anatomy and the consequent
neglect of living animals and their habits are no doubt partly due to
the influence of Huxley, Darwin’s most brilliant follower and exponent.
He had the engineer’s way of looking at the world, and his influence
was paramount in many schools. The trend which biology has taken
since Darwin’s time is also partly due to a fervent belief in the recapitulation
theory, according to which an animal in developing from the
egg passes through phases which resemble certain stages in the past
history of the ancestors of the animal. For example, there is no doubt
that both birds and mammals are descended from some fishlike animal
that lived in the water and breathed by gills borne on slits in the
gullet, and every bird and mammal passes through a stage in which
these gill-slits are present, though their function is lost and they soon
close up and disappear. In the hope, which has been but partially
realized, that a knowledge of the stages through which an animal
passes on its path from the ovum to the adult would throw light on
the origin of the race, the attention of zoölogists has been largely concentrated
on details of embryology, and a mass of facts has already
been accumulated which threatens to overwhelm the worker.</p>

<p>The two chief factors which play a part in the origin of species are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
heredity and variation, and until we know more about the laws which
govern these factors we can not hope to arrive at any satisfactory criteria
by which we can estimate the importance of the data accumulated for
us by comparative anatomists and embryologists. Signs are not wanting
that this view is beginning to be appreciated. The publication of
‘Materials for the Study of Variation,’ by Mr. Bateson, a few years ago,
shows that there exists a small but active school of workers in this
field; and the recent congress on hybridization, held in London under
the auspices of the Royal Horticultural Society, is evidence that in
America, on the Continent and in Great Britain one of the most important
sides of heredity is being minutely and extensively explored.
Prof. Cossar Ewart’s experiments, which we shall attempt to summarize,
deal with heredity and cognate matters, and, although they are so far
from complete that the results hitherto obtained can not be regarded
as final, they mark an important stage in the history of the subject.</p>

<p>Five years ago Professor Ewart began to collect material for the
study of the embryology of the horse, about which, owing to the costliness
of the necessary investigations, very little is at present known. At
the same time he determined to inquire into certain theories of heredity
which have for centuries influenced the breeders of horses and cattle,
and the belief in which has played a large part in the production of our
more highly bred domestic animals. Foremost among these is the view
widely held among breeders that a sire influences all the later progeny of
a dam which has once produced a foal to him. This belief in the
‘infection of the germ,’ or ‘throwing-back’ to a previous sire, is
probably an old one&mdash;possibly as old as the similar faith in maternal
impressions which led Jacob to place peeled wands before the cattle and
sheep of his father-in-law Laban. The phenomenon has recently been
endowed with a new name&mdash;Telegony. Since the publication of Lord
Morton’s letter to Dr. W.&nbsp;H. Wollaston, President of the Royal Society,
in 1820, it has attracted the attention not only of practical breeders,
but of theoretical men of science. The supporters of telegony, when
pressed by opponents, having almost always fallen back on Lord Morton’s
mare, it will be well to recall the chief incidents in the history of
this classic animal.</p>

<p>It appears that early in this century Lord Morton was desirous of
domesticating the quagga. He succeeded in obtaining a male, but,
failing to procure a female, he put him to a young chestnut mare, of
seven eighths Arab blood, which had never been bred from before. The
result was the production of a female hybrid apparently intermediate
in character between the sire and the dam. A short time afterward
Lord Morton sold his mare to Sir Gore Ouseley, who bred from her by
a fine black Arabian horse. The offspring of this union, which were
examined by Lord Morton, were a two-year-old filly and a year-old colt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
He describes them as having “the character of the Arabian breed as
decidedly as can be expected where fifteen sixteenths of the blood are
Arabian, and they are fine specimens of that breed; but both in their
color and in the hair of their manes they have a striking resemblance
to the quagga.” The description of the stripes visible on their coats
is careful and circumstantial, but the evidence of the nature of the mane
is less convincing: “Both their manes are black; that of the filly is
short, stiff, and stands upright, and Sir Gore Ouseley’s stud groom
alleged that it never was otherwise. That of the colt is long, but so
stiff as to arch upward and to hang clear of the sides of the neck, in
which circumstance it resembles that of the hybrid.”</p>

<p>This is the classical, we might almost say the test, case of telegony:
the offspring resembled not so much the sire as an earlier mate of the
dam. The facts related tended to confirm the popular view, and that
view is widely spread. Arab breeders act on the belief, and it is so
strongly implanted in the minds of certain English breeders that they
make a point of mating their mares first with stallions having a good
pedigree, so that their subsequent progeny may benefit by its influence,
even though poorly bred sires are subsequently resorted to.</p>

<p>The evidence of Lord Morton’s mare convinced Darwin of the
existence of telegony; after a careful review of the case he says “there
can be no doubt that the quagga affected the character of the offspring
subsequently got by the black Arabian horse.” Darwin, however, latterly
came to the conclusion that telegony only occurred rarely, and
some years before his death expressed the opinion that it was “a very
occasional phenomenon.” Agassiz believed in telegony. He was
strongly of the opinion “that the act of fecundation is not an act which
is limited in its effects, but that it is an act which affects the whole
system, the sexual system especially; and in the sexual system the ovary
to be impregnated hereafter is so modified by the first act that later impregnations
do not efface that first impression.”</p>

<p>Romanes also believed that telegony occasionally occurred. He
paid a good deal of attention to the matter, commenced experiments in
the hope of settling the question, and corresponded at length on this
subject with professional and amateur breeders and fanciers. The result
of his investigations led him to the conclusion “that the phenomenon
is of much less frequent occurrence than is generally supposed. Indeed,
it is so rare that I doubt whether it takes place in more than one or two
per cent of cases.” A recent controversy in the Contemporary Review
shows us that Mr. Herbert Spencer is a firm upholder of telegony, and
that he has a theory of his own as to the mode in which it is brought
about. He suggests that some ‘germ-plasm’ passes from the embryo
into the mother and becomes a permanent part of her body, and that
this is diffused throughout her whole structure until it affects, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
other organs, the reproductive glands. This view, which in some
respects recalls the pangenesis of Darwin, is intermediate between the
saturation and the infection hypothesis. Professor Ewart refers to it
as indirect infection.</p>

<p>Weismann, to whom we owe the term telegony, came to consider
the facts for and against its existence in connection with his well-known
inquiry into the inheritance of acquired characters. If telegony
be true, there is no need to look further for a clear case of the inheritance
of a character which has been acquired during the lifetime
of the parent. The quagga-ness&mdash;if one may be permitted to use such
an expression&mdash;of Lord Morton’s mare was acquired when she was put
to the quagga or shortly afterward, and was transmitted to her foals.
A clearer case of a character acquired during lifetime and transmitted to
offspring could not be imagined. Weismann does not absolutely deny
the possibility of the existence of telegony, but he would like more
evidence. In the Contemporary Review he writes, “I must say that to
this day, and in spite of the additional cases brought forward by Spencer
and Romanes, I do not consider that telegony has been proved.” And
further: “I should accept a case like that of Lord Morton’s mare as
satisfactory evidence if it were quite certainly beyond doubt. But that
is by no means the case, as Settegast has abundantly proved.” He
would, in fact, refer the case to reversion, and quotes Settegast to the
effect that every horse breeder is well aware that the cases are not rare
when colts are born with stripes which recall the markings of a quagga
or zebra. We shall return to this point later.</p>

<p>A considerable number of German breeders support the contention
of Weismann that telegony is as yet unproved, and it may be pointed
out that in Germany, on the whole, breeders have had a more scientific
education than in England, and that in that country science is regarded
with less aversion or contempt than is usually the case among so-called
practical men in England. We may mention one more case of an experienced
breeder who was equally skeptical&mdash;the late Sir Everett
Millais, who was, as is well known, an authority of great weight in the
matter of dog-breeding. He writes as follows, in a lecture entitled Two
Problems of Reproduction: “I may further adduce the fact that in a
breeding experience of nearly thirty years’ standing, during which I
have made all sorts of experiments with pure-blood dams and wild
sires, and returned them afterward to pure sires of their own breeds,
I have never seen a case of telegony, nor has my breeding stock suffered.
I may further adduce the fact that I have made over fifty experiments
for Professor Romanes to induce a case of telegony in a variety of
animals&mdash;dogs, ducks, hens, pigeons, etc.&mdash;but I have hopelessly failed,
as has every single experimenter who has tried to produce the
phenomenon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
It is thus evident that there is a considerable body of opinion, both
practical and theoretical, for and against telegony; and that a reinvestigation
of the subject is urgently needed. Such a reinvestigation
has been begun by Professor Ewart at Penycuik. Since the clearest
and most definite evidence of this throwing back to a previous sire is
derived from the crossing of different species of the <i>Equidae</i>, it was
desirable to repeat the experiment of Lord Morton. This is now
unfortunately impossible, because the quagga is extinct. The zebra is,
however, still with us, and the mating of a zebra stallion with every
variety of horse, pony, and ass, and subsequently putting the dam to
pure-bred sires, has been the more important part of the numerous
experiments carried on in the Midlothian village some ten miles southwest
of Edinburgh.</p>

<div id="ip_130" class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
  <img src="images/illo_020.jpg" width="386" height="379" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Matopo.</span></div></div>

<p>Before considering in detail the result of the experiments it will
be necessary to say a few words on the question of the various species
of zebra; and since, like Weismann, Professor Ewart explains certain of
the phenomena attributed to telegony by reversion, it will be as well
to inquire how far reversion is known among the <i>Equidae</i>, and what
evidence we have that the ancestor of the horse was striped.</p>

<p>Matopo, the zebra stallion from which Professor Ewart had up
to last midsummer bred eleven zebra-hybrids from mares of various
breeds and sizes, belongs to the widely distributed group of Burchell’s
zebras. Many subspecies or varieties are included in this group, which,
as regards the pattern of the stripes, passes&mdash;in certain varieties found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
in Nyassaland&mdash;into the second species, the mountain zebra, once common
in South Africa. The third species is the Grévy’s zebra of Shoa
and Somaliland; it is probably this species which attracted so much attention
in the Roman amphitheaters during the third century of our
era. A pair of Somali zebras has recently been presented to the queen
by the Emperor Menelik, and is now lodged in the Zoological Gardens,
Regent’s Park. The species measures about fifteen hands high, is profusely
striped, and stands well apart from the other two groups. It is
important to note that, in Professor Ewart’s opinion, it is the most
primitive of all the existing striped horses.</p>

<p>There is no direct evidence that the ancestors of horses were striped.
Certain observers think that some of the scratches on the lifelike
etchings on bone, left us by our palæolithic cave-dwelling ancestors,
indicate such stripes, but little reliance can be placed on this. On the
other hand, there is much indirect evidence. Every one who has an
eye for a horse, and who has traveled in Norway, is sure to have noticed
the stripings, often quite conspicuous, on the dun-colored Norwegian
ponies. Colonel Poole assured Darwin that the Kattiawar horses had
frequently “stripes on the cheeks and sides of the nose.” Breeders are
well aware that foals are often born with stripes, usually on the shoulders
or legs, less frequently on the face. Such stripes, as a rule, disappear
as the colt grows up, but can often be detected in later life for a short
time after the coat has been shed; they are sometimes only visible in
certain lights, and then produce somewhat the same impression as a
watered silk. From the facts that more or less striped horses are found
all over the Old World; that in Mexico and other parts of America
the descendants of horses which were introduced by the Spaniards and
which afterward ran wild are frequently dun-colored and show stripes;
that foals are frequently striped; and that mules not uncommonly have
leg and shoulder stripes, the inference is largely justified that the
ancestors of all our horses were striped.</p>

<p>We now pass to the experiments made at Penycuik in crossing the
zebra Matopo with various mares of different breeds: 1. Matopo was
first mated with Mulatto, one of Lord Arthur Cecil’s black West Highland
ponies. The result was the hybrid Romulus (see p. 132), which on
the whole, both in mental disposition and bodily form, takes more after
his father than his mother. His striping is even more marked than that
of his sire. He has a semi-erect mane which has been shed annually.
The pattern of the markings, on both body and face, resembles the
stripes on a Somali zebra&mdash;which, as we have seen, is regarded by Professor
Ewart as the most primitive type&mdash;more than they resemble that
of any of Burchell’s zebras. The profuse striping is a point of difference
between this hybrid and Lord Morton’s. The quagga-hybrid was less
striped than many dun-colored horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
The mother Mulatto was next mated with a highly bred gray Arab
horse, Benazrek. The offspring agrees in all respects with ordinary
foals; it had, however, a certain number of indistinct stripes, which
could only be detected in certain lights. The stripes were not nearly so
clear as in a foal bred by Mr. Darwin from a cross-bred bay mare and a
thoroughbred, and they disappeared entirely in about five months.</p>

<div id="ip_132" class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Romulus, Twenty-seven Days Old.</span></div></div>

<p>Recently Mulatto has produced a third foal to Loch Corrie, a sire belonging
to the Isle of Rum group of West Highland ponies, and closely
resembling his mate. This foal was about as much striped as its immediate
predecessor. In both cases the pattern of the stripe differed
not only from that of Matopo, the previous sire, but from that of the
hybrid Romulus. These two foals seem to lend some support to telegony;
but the evidence which might be drawn from the second of them
is destroyed by the fact that the sire Loch Corrie has produced foals
from two West Highland mares, one brown and one black, and each
of these foals has as many and as well marked stripes as the foal of
Mulatto.</p>

<p>2. Four attempts were made to cross the zebra with Shetland ponies;
only one succeeded. The hybrid was a smaller edition of Romulus. The
dam Nora had been bred from before, and had produced, by a black
Shetland pony, a foal of a dun color which was markedly striped. After
the birth of the hybrid she was put to a bay Welsh pony; the resulting
foal had only the faintest indication of stripes, which soon disappeared.
It is a remarkable fact that Nora’s foals were more striped before she
had been mated with the zebra than afterward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
3. Five Icelandic ponies were mated with Matopo, of whom one
produced, in 1897, a dark-colored hybrid. The dam, Tundra, was a
yellow and white skewbald which had previously produced a light bay
foal to a stallion of its own breed. Her third foal (1898) was fathered by
a bay Shetland pony, and in coloration closely resembled its dam.
There was no hint of infection in this case. This year Professor Ewart
has bred from this mare, by Matopo, a zebra-hybrid of a creamy-fawn
color, and so primitive in its markings that he believes it to stand in
much the same relation to horses, zebras, and asses as the blue-rock
does to the various breeds of pigeons (see illustration).</p>

<div id="ip_133" class="figcenter" style="width: 534px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Tundra (an Iceland Pony), her Foal, Circus Girl (born 1898), and her Hybrid
Foal, Sir John (by Matopo), when a Month Old (born 1899).</span></div></div>

<p>4. Two Irish mares, both bays, produced hybrids by Matopo, and
subsequently bore pure-bred foals. One of the latter was by a thoroughbred
horse, the other by a hackney pony. The foals were without
stripes, and showed no kind of indication that their mother had ever
been mated with a zebra.</p>

<p>5. Although Professor Ewart experimented with seven English
thoroughbred mares and an Arab, he only succeeded in one case. The
mare produced twin hybrids, one of which unfortunately died immediately
after birth. This summer the same mare has produced a foal
to a thoroughbred chestnut; “neither in make, color, nor action” does it
in any way resemble a zebra or a zebra-hybrid.</p>

<p>6. A bay mare which had been in foal to Matopo for some months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
miscarried. Here&mdash;if there is anything in the direct infection theory&mdash;the
unused germ-cells of the zebra had a better chance than usual
of reaching the ova from which future offspring are to arise, yet neither
of the two foals which this mare subsequently produced to a thoroughbred
horse “in any way suggests a zebra.”</p>

<p>The above is the record of the successful experiments which have
been tried at Penycuik, with a view of throwing light on the existence
of telegony in the <i>Equidae</i>. Experiments have also been made with
other animals, such as rabbits, dogs, pigeons, fowls, and ducks. Space
allows us to quote but one. Six white doe rabbits, all of which
had borne pure white offspring to white bucks, were crossed with wild
brown rabbits. The result was forty-two young rabbits, all of a bluish-black
color, which in a very short time turned to a brown. These, at
the time of writing, were about half grown, and Professor Ewart tells
us that it is almost impossible to distinguish them from a full-blooded
wild rabbit kept in the same inclosure. The half-breeds, however,
were tamer and slightly lighter in color. The mother does next bred
with white bucks again, and in every case bred true. The pure white
young showed no trace of throwing back to a previous sire.</p>

<p>A phenomenon somewhat similar to telegony, and one which seems
at present quite unexplained, is that a hen which has been crossed
with a cock of another breed often lays eggs whose shell is no longer
like that of its own breed, but in color, and frequently in texture,
resembles that of the breed with which it has been crossed. When one
calls to mind that the shell is deposited by a special shell-gland which
is in no way connected with the ovary, but is a part of the quite
distinct oviduct, and that the change in the color of the eggshell
must be caused by some change brought about in this gland by cross-fertilization,
we begin to recognize how mysterious and inexplicable
are many of the problems which affect breeding.</p>

<p>Throughout his account of his experiments Professor Ewart is
extremely cautious in claiming to prove anything, but we think he has
justified his claim to have shown that telegony by no means always
occurs, as many breeders believe. His experiments so far support the
view of Continental mule breeders, that telegony, if it takes place,
occurs very seldom. But the experiments are not complete, and it is
much to be hoped that they may be continued. If it should subsequently
appear that out of fifty pure-bred foals from dams which have
been previously mated with the zebra no single instance of telegony be
found, the doctrine may surely be neglected by breeders; and if in the
experiments which are now being carried out with various other mammals
and birds telegony does not occur, the doctrine may be relegated
to the ‘dumping-ground’ of old superstitions. The present state of
the matter may be summed up in the professor’s own words: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
experiments, as far as they have gone, afford no evidence in support of
the telegony hypothesis.” Nothing has occurred which is not explicable
on the theory of reversion.</p>

<p>There is no factor in breeding of more importance than prepotency,
and none which is more difficult to estimate. The term is necessarily
a relative one, and, further, it may affect some characters and not others.
Often it must go undetected, as in the case of the leader of a herd of
wild cattle, who may be highly prepotent, but whose prepotency, unless
he is mated with members of another herd displaying different characters,
may pass unnoticed. Breeders claim to be able to produce cattle
so prepotent that they will produce their like, however mated. A
well-known dealer in highly-bred ponies used to boast that he had a filly
so prepotent that, though she were sent to the best Clydesdale stallion
in Scotland, she would throw a colt showing no cart-horse blood. Prepotency
is usually obtained by inbreeding, which up to a certain point
fixes the character of a race, and in all cases tends to check variation
and reversion&mdash;the Jews, for instance, as a race are strongly prepotent&mdash;but
there is no doubt that it may also arise as a sport, and this is
probably its more usual origin in a state of Nature. Professor Ewart,
however, believes that inbreeding is much commoner among wild
animals than has usually been conceded, and he holds the opinion that
the prepotency so induced has played a considerable part in the origin
of species. This, if true, would to some extent take the place of
Romanes’ ‘physiological selection’; for Romanes also thought that,
though of great importance, variation and natural selection were insufficient
to account for the origin of species without some factor which
would help to mitigate the swamping effect of intercrossing&mdash;some such
agency as the fences of modern farms and cattle ranches&mdash;without
which the famous cattle breeds of the world would soon disappear in a
general ‘regression toward mediocrity.’</p>

<p>In inbreeding the great difficulty of the breeder is to know when
to stop. Carried too far it undoubtedly leads to degeneracy. In the
‘Domesticated Animals of Great Britain,’ Low records the case of a
gentleman who inbred foxhounds to such an extent that “the race
actually became monstrous and perished.” Hogs, if too closely inbred,
grow hair instead of bristles; their legs become short and unable to
support the body; and not only is their fertility diminished, but the
mothers can not nourish the young.</p>

<p>So far as is known, no direct investigations have been made to
test how far inbreeding may be carried in the <i>Equidae</i>; but, on the
other hand, the breeding of race-horses may perhaps be looked upon
as a gigantic experiment in this direction. Our English thoroughbreds
can be traced back to a few imported sires&mdash;the Byerly Turk,
imported in 1689; the Darley Arabian, in 1710; and the Godolphin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Arabian, in 1730. Since then, by careful breeding and nutrition, they
have increased on an average some eight or nine inches in height.
There is, however, a widely spread impression that at present there is a
marked deterioration in the staying power and in the general ‘fitness’
of the racer. The falling off is further shown by a fact commented on
by Sir Walter Gilbey&mdash;viz., “the smallness of the percentage of even
tolerably successful horses out of a prodigious number bred at an enormous
outlay.” In support of this he quotes a sentence from the <i>Times</i>
(December 27, 1897), referring to a sale in which thirty-two yearlings
had been sold for 51,250 guineas: “These thirty-two yearlings” (said
the <i>Times</i>) “are represented by two winners of five races, Florio Rubattino
and La Reine, who have contributed about 2,000<i>l.</i> to the total cost;
and there is not, so far as can be known, a single one of the thirty
others with any prospect of making a race-horse.”</p>

<p>If, then, it is true that the English race-horse is on the down grade,
what steps should be taken to arrest this descent? Sir Everett Millais
restored a pack of basset hounds by crossing them with a bloodhound,
the original forefather of bassets. The resulting pups were bassets in
form, but not quite bassets in color; when, however, these cross-breeds
were mated with bassets the majority of the pups turned out to be perfect
bassets both in shape and coloration. This indicates that one way to
rejuvenate the race-horse would be to have recourse to a new importation
of the best Arab mares that the plains of Arabia can produce.
Breeders hesitate to adopt this course, because their present breed is
not only larger but, over very short distances, fleeter than its forefathers.
The shortening of the course in recent years is probably a
further sign of the degeneracy of our present racers. Were new blood
introduced and more three- or four-mile races instituted, we should
doubtless soon have a return to the champion form of bygone days.
Another method would be to import some of the racers of Australia
or New Zealand and cross them with the home product. Different surroundings,
food, etc., soon influence the constitution, and this being so,
it would be advisable to select those horses of pure descent which have
been longest subjected to these altered conditions. Thus the chance of
reversion occurring would be increased.</p>

<p>It has been noticed more than once in the preceding pages that a
young animal showing reversion is strong and vigorous. It is the belief
of dog breeders that those members of an inbred litter which show
reversion are the strongest and best. Similarly, experience shows that
if an inbred sire and dam produce a dun-colored striped foal it almost
always turns out well. Reversion is accompanied by a rejuvenescence;
it is as though the young animal had appeared at an earlier period in
the life history of the race, before the race had undergone those changes
in the way of deterioration which so often accompany inbreeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Wild animals are frequently thought to be prepotent over tame ones,
but of the eleven zebra-hybrids bred at Penycuik only two took markedly
after their sire, the zebra <span class="locked">Matopo.<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span> There are other experiments
recounted which tell the other way, and at present this matter remains
in a state of considerable uncertainty.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> The illustration shows the difference between the facial marks of the zebra and those of the
hybrid. The latter, in this respect, bears much the same relation to the former as a blue-rock
pigeon does to a fancy type.</p></div>

<p>This article must not close without a word or two more about
the zebra-hybrids. It is mentioned above that only two out of the
eleven which have already been born took strongly after their father.</p>

<p>Those who have seen the young hybrids playing about in the fields
at Penycuik must agree that they are the most charming and compactly
built little animals possible. Of Romulus, the eldest of the herd, Professor
Ewart says: “When a few days old [he] was the most attractive
little creature I have ever seen. He seemed to combine all the grace
and beauty of an antelope and a well-bred Arab foal.... What
has struck me from the first has been his alertness and the expedition
with which he escapes from suspicious or unfamiliar objects. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
quite young, if caught napping in the paddock, the facility with which
he, as it were, rolled on to his feet and darted off was wonderful.”</p>

<p>The writer can fully confirm all the praise Professor Ewart lavishes
on his pets; in truth, Romulus has been well described as a “bonnie
colt with rare quality of bone ... and with the dainty step and the
dignity of the zebra.” Remus, the offspring of the Irish mare, has
been from the first more friendly than his half-brother; he objected less
to the process of weaning, and, if he survives, promises to be the handsomest
and fleetest of the existing hybrids.</p>

<p>On the whole, the hybrids are unusually hardy; only two have been
lost&mdash;one, a twin, which died almost as soon as it was born, and another
which lived some three months and then succumbed. It is only fair
to say that the dam of the latter, who was only three years old when
the hybrid was born, had been much weakened by attacks of the
strongylus worm, and that she was the victim of close inbreeding.
Both the zebras and the hybrids which have been under observation at
Penycuik show a remarkable capacity for recovering from wounds.
Accidental injuries heal with great rapidity. On one occasion the surviving
twin was discovered with a flap of skin some five inches long
hanging down over the front of the left fetlock. The skin was stitched
into its place again, during which operation the little hybrid fought
desperately and cried piteously; but it soon recovered, the wound
healed, and now scarcely a scar remains. There was no lameness and
no swelling either at the fetlock or above the knee. About a year ago
four hybrid colts and three ordinary foals were attacked by that scourge
of the stable, the strongylus worm. One of the latter died and another
was reduced almost to a skeleton; the hybrids, though obviously affected,
suffered much less than the others and soon recovered. It is further
noticeable that the hybrids suffer less from colds and other slight ailments
than the mares and horses among which they live.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that it is a comparatively easy matter to breed
these hybrids, and that they are not only extremely attractive animals
to the eye, but hardy and vigorous, possessed of great staying powers,
and promising to be capable of severe work.</p>

<p>From what we have said, it is evident that the Penycuik experiments
are of the highest interest, both practical and theoretical, and the
public spirit and self-devotion shown by the Edinburgh professor in
carrying them out can not be too widely recognized.</p>

<h2 title="Colonies and the Mother Country" id="colonies">COLONIES AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY. (I.)<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By JAMES COLLIER.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">We</span> may conceive a country, with its colonies and dependencies
grouped round it at unequal distances and in different directions,
as a giant organism, which has its laws of growth and development,
its phases of expansion, activity and decay, like all other
organisms. We see it enlarging in mass, but to the last remaining
amorphous, or assimilable to no known forms. We observe the heart
and brain fostering, helping and sometimes hindering, directing, controlling
and guarding the evolution of the nearer or remoter portions.
We perceive on scrutiny threads of relationship being woven, new
nervous, muscular and circulatory systems being developed, which
connect the extremities with the center and unite both into an organic
whole. We are struck at times with the rupture of the mass and the
permanent separation of parts of it; at times we are impressed by
an unexpected augmentation in previously unknown areas, as if to
repair the loss of the old. We witness the extremities reacting on the
original nucleus, to some extent remodeling the heart and brain and
thus creating a type of organism unprecedented in Nature. And we
find that of a limited number of such colossal types, ever battling for
predominance, one or another gains an ascendency and the rest are
reduced to a secondary rank, or, being lopped of their colonial extensions,
cease to be world-wide organisms and shrink into the merely
national organisms from which they sprang.</p>

<p>Snails put out their feelers as they go. The bolder insects and
the more adventurous birds fly small or great distances in search of a
feeding ground; some are carried out to sea, and become involuntary
‘discoverers’ of new <span class="locked">lands.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></span> The social organism puts out its feelers
and extends in mass. The community pushes out its scouts, and a
portion of it, at longer or shorter intervals, follows their lead. Thus
the mother country discovers many of the territories it colonizes.
Cadiz was unknown to the Eastern world till a Phœnician merchant
ship was blown thither. The West African coast and the mouth of
the Rhone were discovered by the Carthaginians. Libya (west of
Egypt) was a <i>terra incognita</i> to the Greeks till a Greek sailor who had
been driven on its inhospitable coast informed the emigrant Theræans
of its existence. The Portuguese discovered the Azores. The Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
discovered the West India Islands, Mexico, Peru and Florida.
France discovered the country lying along the basin of the St. Lawrence
and the valley of the Mississippi. Holland, through an English navigator,
discovered the Hudson River and the future site of New York.
England, through another alien, discovered the New England coast and
that of Virginia; it discovered, or rediscovered, vast Australia, New
Zealand, Tasmania and other South Sea islands; in quite recent years it
discovered the sources of the Nile. All these countries have been or
are about to be colonized by the peoples that discovered them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C" id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> Examples of insects are given in Darwin’s ‘Journal,’ and of birds in Wallace’s ‘Malay
Archipelago.’</p></div>

<p>Discovery is chiefly the work of private enterprise. It was Phœnician
and Greek traders who explored the northern and western coasts
of Africa, of Spain, of Gaul, and of Britain. Scandinavian mariners,
Norman and English fishermen, discovered North America. Spanish
adventurers found the Canaries. The host of travelers have explored
on their private account. Yet there are animals, like Mr. Thompson’s
Lobo, the wolf, and Spot, the crow, able generals and leaders of large
bands, who seem to direct exploratory movements. So after a while
governments lend their aid when they have ends of their own or
their aid is needed. The two most memorable exploring expeditions of
modern times, and the most momentous in their results, were either in
great part or wholly equipped by their respective governments.
Two of the vessels of Columbus were impressed ships, and the equipment
proceeded from the Castilian treasury, the third being fitted out
by merchant mariners of Palos. The expedition of Captain Cook,
which practically added a new continent to the globe, was altogether a
state enterprise, and its celebrated commander was not, like Columbus,
its designer and organizer, but only its director. The Portuguese
discoveries of the Azores and the Cape were also state-aided. From
this time forward Spanish and Portuguese adventurers received a royal
license to discover, and the South American continent, with Mexico
and Peru as its brightest jewels, was discovered by just such adventurers.
Where a government refuses itself to discover, it may, like the
States-General of Holland, assure to the enterprising a terminable
monopoly of trade with newly discovered lands, and to this assurance
the exploration of New York and its neighborhood and the discovery
of Connecticut were due. Merchant companies have naturally a keen
eye to the main chance, but those English and Dutch merchants can
not be accused of timidity who chartered Cabot, Gilbert, Hudson and
other daring mariners to seek a northwest passage to the East. Kings,
in their private capacity, newspaper proprietors and rich individuals,
from generous motives, sometimes equip and support explorers like
Stanley and Winwood Reade.</p>

<p>Geographical, like scientific, discovery is often accidental. Phœnician
and Greek traders, Spanish adventurers, Norman and English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
fishermen were blown by a succession of gales to Cadiz and Cyrene, the
Canaries, Mexico and Newfoundland. Diaz was storm-carried southward
to the Cape, where two shipwrecked mariners long afterward induced
the Dutch to settle. Columbus, Cabot and Hudson sought a
passage to India or China. The day comes, however, when chance gives
way to a systematic art of discovery. The voyage of Columbus was the
first where the end was deliberately aimed at and patiently worked up
to. Under Ferdinand the Catholic maritime discovery was raised to an
art. A board of eminent Spanish navigators, with Vespucci at its
head, sat to construct charts and trace out routes for projected voyages.
The primary object of Cook’s first voyage was astronomical, and he was
scientifically equipped for discovery on that, as of course also on the
two later voyages, whose sole end was the one so gloriously gained.</p>

<p>Prior discovery confers an indefeasible title to occupy as against any
other colonizing power. Misled by a false statement, a British man-of-war
entered the Mississippi presumably to take possession of Louisiana,
but turned aside on being informed of the earlier French occupation.
In the thirties two naval expeditions were exploring at the same time
in Spencer Gulf, South Australia. Though the French gracefully
yielded the <i>pas</i> to the prior English ship, they left a mark on a number
of points that still bear French names. There seems to be now no
doubt that Brazil had been discovered and rediscovered by Spanish
navigators before the Portuguese <i>carbajal</i> set foot on it, but, owing
to an international agreement, the discoverers ceded their claim.</p>

<p>Discovery does not necessarily issue in colonization. The more
or less mythical discoveries of the coasts of North America and Australia
in the ninth and sixteenth centuries interest the antiquarian
rather than the historian. They resemble the so-called anticipations
of scientific discoveries&mdash;Cesalpino’s, of Harvey; Vico’s, of Wolf and
Niebuhr; Swedenborg’s, of Kant; and a host of guessers, of Darwin.
As proof alone is discovery in science, so only exploration is discovery in
geography. For lack of this essential element even well-certified discoveries
are apt to be fruitless. Tasman’s frightened glimpse of New
Zealand and his more careful coasting of Tasmania left durable marks
on both countries, but only in nomenclature. They led to nothing.
No Dutch settlement seems ever to have been made south of New
Guinea; no northern nationality is more conspicuously absent among
the colonizers of the South Seas. The earlier Portuguese discovery of
the Cape of Good Hope was regarded as that of a halfway house
to a more distant goal; they stopped to recruit, then hurried off
to rich Cathay. The French left their names to a dozen headlands and
rivers on the coast of Western Australia, but, though they often excited
the suspicions of New South Wales, they made no attempt to settle.</p>

<p>Discovery, to assure sovereignty over the discovered country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
must be followed, among animals as among men, by effective occupation.
The Portuguese were roused into warlike excitement a few years ago by
the advance of the Chartered Company into Mashonaland, where their
settlements had long ceased to exist. Their claims to the basin of the
Congo were on the same ground equally disregarded&mdash;this time by all
the powers. A bit of seacoast can more easily be kept, and Delagoa
Bay was assured to them by the French arbitrator. Mere occupation
has at various times given a valid right to a territory. The
Puritans found several islands off the New England coast to be destitute
of inhabitants, and the shores so thinned of Indians by an
epidemic as to be practically uninhabited. Yet they were careful to
assure their title by purchase. The Manowolko Islands of the Malay
Archipelago were without indigenes when the first settlers arrived.
Pitcairn and Norfolk Islands were found by the mutineers of the
Bounty and the convicts from New South Wales to answer to Defoe’s
notion of a desert island. The first English settlers in Australia and
the first French settlers in New Caledonia met with no resistance from
the blacks at the initial stages of occupation. When the Boers trekked
across the Vaal they entered on a country that had been left, through
exterminating native wars, to the beasts of the field and the forest.
The situation is very different when a rival civilized power lays claims
to the territory. When Great Britain forcibly took possession of West
Griqualand in 1871 she had to salve, without satisfying, the claims of
the Orange Free State to one of the richest diamond fields in the world
by a payment differently stated at £90,000 and over £100,000. Having
to deal with a European power, she was constrained to submit to arbitration
her pretensions to the so very useful and convenient Delagoa
Bay. In attempting to extend British Guiana, so as to gain command
of the Orinoco, she came into collision with the mightiest of American
peoples, which now guards the interests of all the others. The United
States refused to acknowledge the doctrine of ‘squatter sovereignty,’
and one of the preliminaries of the Venezuela arbitration was the
addition to international law of the rule that a period of fifty years’
uninterrupted occupancy was required to constitute valid sovereignty.
England has gone through the world, like Sir Tantalus’s man with his
iron flail, beating down the weak and robbing the helpless. Yet few
countries can show an equal record of honorable renunciations. It
long refused to annex New Zealand, now one of the finest of its colonies.
It long refused Fiji and Natal. It refused Samoa. It refused Bechuanaland
for a time. It refused Angra Pequena. It would not listen
to the discoverer who called on it to occupy equatorial Africa. It
disavowed the action of Queensland in annexing New Guinea. It surrendered
the Ionian Islands. Its constant injunction to its high commissioner
in South Africa was not to advance the line of conquest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
It surrendered, in 1854, its sovereignty over the Boers of the
Orange River. That surrender was condemned by British governors,
is still condemned by historians, and was disliked by the wealthier and
more intelligent Boers; how wise and just it was is shown by the
jealousy with which the republic has since watched over its independence.
To its eternal honor&mdash;or rather to that of Gladstone&mdash;it nobly
gave back the Transvaal to its stalwart farmers. France long relinquished
Algeria and Madagascar, which her missions and commercial
stations in the seventeenth century gave her a prescriptive right to
occupy two centuries later. It refused to support De La Tours, and
abandoned Labourdonnais and Dupleix. Through mere inertia Portugal
has let slip from her hands a grand inheritance. The Dutch repressed
the extension of their colony at the Cape. Java flourishes, but
Dutch New Guinea lies rotting.</p>

<p>A species, extending beyond its original habitat, has often to
battle with lower species already in possession of that portion of the
earth or water. So, except in rare cases, occupation means the necessity
of conquest. The Puritans, as they advanced into the interior, had
to fight for the possession of New England. The nomadic Australian
blacks offered no resistance to the earliest settlers, but as they were
driven inward they disputed, and are still fiercely disputing, every foot
of territory. As the indigenes rise in the scale, have clearings and
cultivate the soil, the resistance increases. No savage peoples have
cost the invaders so much in disturbance, blood and treasure as the
Indians, Maoris, Kaffirs and Algerian Arabs. Mashonaland was occupied
by the Chartered Company without firing a shot or losing a life,
but it had soon to fight for possession. The incessant turmoil, though
the waves of it spread to the remote mother country, affects the settlers
mainly. The blood shed is both colonial and metropolitan. The
North American settlers fought their own hard battles; though British
troops engaged, to their cost, with the Indians, it was against these as
allies of the French; in recent years the British garrison in Canada has
been employed against the half-castes. In New Zealand colonial volunteers
joined with the regular troops to defeat the Maoris, and the
former were sometimes found the more efficient.</p>

<p>The most picturesque conquests in history were effected by private
enterprise. Mexico was conquered by local recruits. Pizarro was authorized
to conquer Peru in the name of the Spanish crown, and, besides
various other encouragements, he received a modest sum from the
Spanish treasury. But it was again by local recruits, not one of them
furnished by the Spanish Government, that the conquest was made and
maintained. Algeria has a very different story to tell. The troops employed
in effecting a difficult conquest spread over thirty years were
French from first to last. In general, it may be said that where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
have been regular campaigns and pitched battles the metropolitan
troops bear the brunt of the fighting. Where there is a guerrilla warfare,
as with the Australian blacks, it is carried on by the colonial
police or by the settlers, sometimes with the aid of the natives themselves.
The Carthaginians built up their empire by native auxiliaries.
The French and English conquered Canada with the Hurons and Iroquois
as auxiliaries. The English mastered New Zealand with Maoris
for allies, and defeated the Kaffirs with the help of the Fingoes (a
related variety of the Bantu race). Rhodesia was won by a force half
Kaffir. Peruvians aided Pizarro. India has been made British by
armies of which four fifths were Indian. A people, like a man, contributes
to its own subjugation. The expense is likewise distributed.
Fifty years of intermittent war with the Kaffirs cost Great Britain
twelve million pounds, and it may safely be assumed that a no smaller
sum was expended in New Zealand. The colonists honorably bear their
share. The premier of the latter colony told a London audience in
jubilee year that it was now cheerfully paying the interest on a debt
of eleven millions incurred in “holding the colony for the empire.”
After a Kaffir war Cape Colony was saddled with a debt of three or
four millions. Other losses fall more directly on the settlers. Probably
none have borne such disasters and so much suffering as the early
colonists of North America. The destruction of property in a single
New Zealand campaign amounted to £150,000, and the farmers on the
frontiers of Cape Colony have suffered far more severely, as those on the
frontier of Queensland are suffering now. If blood and money, poured
forth like water, can furnish conquest with a valid title to territory, not
a few British and French colonies have been justly annexed.</p>

<p>The expansion of an organism or a species is determined also by
its struggle with other equal organisms or species which conflict with
it. The hardest fight is with individuals of the same or similar
species. So are rival colonizing powers usually more formidable opponents
to the acquisition of a country than its indigenes. The Carthaginians
were robbed of some of their colonies by the more numerous
Greeks, and the Greeks of many of theirs by the all-conquering Romans.
The Swedes lost a colony to the Dutch. The short but decisive struggle
between the Dutch and the English was followed by the loss of the
Dutch colonies in North America and the West Indies. In the eighteenth
century, after every great war a group of colonies fell into the
hands of the victorious power. The West India Islands and those of
the Indian Ocean were for many years tossed as in a game of battledore
and shuttlecock between France and England. The possession of Canada
was a bone of contention between the two countries for several
decades. Seeley even maintains that the hundred years’ war ending
in 1815 was a long rivalry between France and England for the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
World and India. If so, it was marked by striking acts of generosity.
Conquests made in Canada by England, with the efficient aid of the
American colonies, were more than once given back to France. When
all but two of the West India colonies were surrendered in 1814 the
Foreign Minister explained that it was desired to open to France the
means of peaceful expansion, and it was not the interest of England
to make her a military and conquering power. The rivalry did not
end with the Napoleonic wars. According to one historian, Australia
was saved to the English in 1788 by six days, and for long afterward
there was a constant jealousy of French occupation. Ships were sent
by Australian governors to take possession of Van Diemen’s Land, of
southern, western and northern Australia when it was believed that
the French had designs on them. An English war ship, sent by the
governor of the North Island of New Zealand to annex the rich and
fertile South Island, anticipated by only a few hours a French ship
dispatched for the same purpose. The rising of the French Canadians
in 1838 has been described as “the last convulsion of despair of a
sinking nationality.” The English, French, and now the Germans
are still rivals in present and future colonizing grounds in Africa,
China, and the South Seas. But no British colonist doubts that further
pacific defeats (if only by being bought out of their possessions)
await the French in different quarters of the globe, for it is the colonies
that press forward. The North American colonies were at all times
more aggressive than the mother state, as the Australasian are now.
They are unconsciously on the way to become the suns of new systems.</p>

<p>Conquests may be made on various pretexts. The Cape was twice
seized by the English to prevent it from falling into the hands of the
French, and a few years later the Dutch were constrained to cede the
colony to its temporary possessors. Gambetta schemed to annex and
colonize the whole North African coast from Egypt to Morocco, and
thus to create a <i>France nouvelle</i> along the northern shores of the
Mediterranean in place of the New France lost in Canada more than a
century before, or of that still older New France on the shores of the
Bosporus. In pursuance of this policy, the powers at the Berlin Conference
in 1878 permitted France to occupy (not to annex) Tunis,
prohibiting her, however, from fortifying its chief port. But no one
doubts that the ‘regency’ there, as in Madagascar, will speedily give
way to undisputed sovereignty, and Bizerta is already fortified. Writers
are said to be dreamers, and Locke’s constitution for Carolina, Rousseau’s
for Corsica, Bentham’s for Russia, with many another quixotic
proposal, furnish proof of their simplicity or their wrong-headedness.
It is nevertheless a fact that most of the new ideas that are being
carried into effect are the suggestions of publicists&mdash;journalists who
stand midway between men of thought and men of action. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the former contribute immediately practicable proposals. Russia, Germany,
France, and Great Britain&mdash;the four grasping powers&mdash;along
with Italy and Belgium, are now, after a digestive interval of thirty
years, carrying out a suggestion made by Renan in 1871. The Chinese,
who threw off the yoke of the conquering Mongols, belong (it appears)
by ordination of Nature to the subject races. The people that produced
Confucius and Lao-tze consist of laboring men who need direction
and organization. China, therefore, calls for conquest. The
powers have obeyed the call, and that vast and peaceful land is now
undergoing dismemberment, with a view to final wholesale partition.
It is a parallel to the conquest of Peru by the Spaniards. In both
countries a more perfect civilization of a lower type was or will be
superseded by a less perfect civilization of a higher type. In this alone
lies its assumed justification. Evidently the argument may be carried
far. It would justify Russia in occupying Turkey, the United States
in conquering not only Spanish colonies but Spain itself. It was the
moral justification of the Gothic invasions of the early Christian centuries.
It is a sentence of death or (it may be) of new life to all
moribund nationalities.</p>

<p>Other modes of acquiring colonies are by cession and by purchase.
The former is often disguised conquest, like that of the Cape to England.
The latter may be so as well, like that of the African diamond
fields by England. Colbert bought, for less than a million francs,
certain of the West India Islands and the Antilles. The United
States has bought her last colonies from dying Spain for four million
pounds. At no distant time the Australian colonies will probably buy
France and Germany out of the Pacific, and Holland and Germany out
of New Guinea. It will be none the less a moral conquest. The
right of the stronger, or the more fit to colonize, will still be, as it ever
has been, the sole title to possess.</p>

<p>By these various means habitats have been found for future colonies,
spheres for future colonial expansion.</p>

<h2 title="The Future of the Negro in the Southern States" id="future">THE FUTURE OF THE NEGRO IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Professor N. S. SHALER</span>,<br />

<span class="small">HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Whatever</span> danger there may be of serious conflict between the
negroes and whites in the Southern States&mdash;at most but slight&mdash;is
likely to arise from the fact that the old class of slaveholders,
men accustomed to hold a caretaking relation to the lower race, is passing
away. Already the greater number of the white people know the
blacks only as they are known by the Northern folk. Race prejudice,
which in the days of slavery was hardly more than formal, finding
expression mainly in certain rules as to the behavior of the inferior
class, is likely to increase in proportion as the two peoples become
parted from one another in interests. If the present movement to disfranchise
the negroes should lead to their general and permanent
separation from political life, or if in elections they should again array
themselves as they did immediately after the war&mdash;under the lead of
white adventurers against the property interests of the commonwealth&mdash;then
there may be disaster. The aim of the statesman&mdash;of every citizen
in his quality of a statesman&mdash;should be to make the present political
separation of the races, as far as possible, temporary. Their effort should
be to develop in the blacks the qualities which may make them safe
holders of the franchise, and to give that trust to all who become
worthy of it. We may at once put aside all the futile expedients for
other dispositions of the negroes than the simple plan of adopting
them into our national life. The ancient project of returning them to
Africa, the suggestions that they should be deported to some part of the
American tropics, or be segregated in some one of the Southern States,
are all too impracticable to deserve a moment’s attention. They
must be dismissed, if for no other reason, because the labor of the negroes
is needed where they now dwell. Their exodus would mean the commercial
ruin of half a dozen great States. It is hardly necessary to
suggest that any such action would involve a trespass upon the rights
of both the whites and blacks too great to be thought of in our day.</p>

<p>Assuming that the only thing to do with the negroes is to shape
them so that they may be fit for the place of citizens, the question is
as to the steps which may be taken to attain this end. It is evident
that it cannot quickly be done. Acting on the basis of our experience
with immigrants from Europe, a majority of Congress concluded that
all the negro needed to convert him from the slave to the truly free man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
was the ballot. We failed to see that between the primitive station of
our race, two thousand years ago, and its present state there lay twenty
centuries of toil and pain, spent in winning the state of mind of the
citizen. We mocked the African with the gift of the franchise. We
have now to begin where we should have begun thirty-five years ago,
with measures that are proportionate to the need&mdash;with a system of
education that may serve to develop the saving qualities of the race.
What should this education be?</p>

<p>To most of us education begins with an alphabet and goes on to
an indetermined limit of things that are to be had from books. The
method is naturally esteemed, for we behold that the useful citizen
comes forth from such teaching. Yet, logically, we might as well
attribute the shape and quality of the body to the clothes it bears.
The real education of our race, that which gives the most of its value
to the trifle of instruction we give our children, is clearly a matter of
race experience; of training in the generations of deeds since it began
to pass from primitive savagery. First came the lessons in the art of
continually laboring. Fortunately this lesson of labor the negro either
brought with him, or learned so well in the generations of slavery that
it is safely acquired. Next came the training in the occupations above
the plane of simple agriculture&mdash;the industries of the forge, the loom,
the ship and of military service and with it the habits of associated
action. Along with these came the development of the commercial
sense with the enlargements of view it gives, and from this the common
sense of public affairs that makes a democracy possible. We assumed
all this race training in the African when we cast him the ballot. Now
that he has failed to profit by our folly, we begin to doubt whether
there is, after all, the making of a citizen in him. A reasonable view
of the facts leads us to conclude that he can be made a valuable citizen,
provided he has a fair share of real help in the task of becoming such.</p>

<p>The first need of the negro is the conviction that his salvation
depends upon himself. So long as he is deluded by the hope that some
great external power is to lift him to the social and economic level of
the whites, there is no chance that he will come to depend on himself
for advancement. From this point of view, at least, it is advantageous
that the attention of this country is for the time turned away from them
in a search for other, and less practicable endeavors, to lift lowly
peoples to the Saxon’s estate. The next is that the negroes be as
rapidly as possible employed in varied craft work&mdash;work in which they
may receive a larger training than the toil the fields afford. The
simple yet valuable lessons of the soil-tiller they have had. For the
greater number of their race, particularly those of the Guinea type,
this grade of employment is as high as they may be expected to attain.
Yet somewhere near one-third of the people of their color are fit for employments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
demanding more skill and, because of that skill, giving a
better intellectual station. The mechanical employments of the day
are ever gaining in their culture-giving powers. The complication of
the machines which are used, and the mysterious nature of the powers
which they apply, seem to make them more effective means of enlargement
than the old simple tools. Those who have observed the process
by which the horse-car driver of a decade ago has been converted into
the motor-man of to-day have had a chance to see what the control of
energies may do for them. I feel safe in saying, from the basis of
personal experience with the negroes, that somewhere near one third of
them are fit to be trained for mechanical employment of a fairly high
grade. They will need more instruction than the average whites, but
they will have a keen interest in their work, and are more likely than
the whites to lead up their children in their own trades. For such
employment the types which, for lack of a better name, I have termed
the Zulu and the Semetic are clearly well fitted. Here and there in
the South we find these people of the abler stocks already so employed.</p>

<p>There seems no reason to believe that there is at present enough
race prejudice in the South to oppose any effective resistance to negroes
entering on any such employment as that of the engineer. It is true
that among the women operatives in spinning and weaving mills there
has been such objection already found as to make it impossible to employ
the negro and white in the same rooms. It is, however, improbable
that there would be any opposition to having the black women
engaged in the industry, provided the personal association with the
whites was not required. Whatever resistance it would be necessary
to overcome in order to make the negro free to engineering employments
would proceed from the poor white class or from Northern loom
operators who brought to the South the obdurate hatred of the negro
which is so strong in the regions where he is rarely seen. The old
slave-holding class, and those who inherit their motives, will, I am
convinced, welcome the effort to open such places to well-trained blacks.
As an evidence of the state of mind of this ruling class, I may relate an
experience of a year or two ago in one of the most remote corners
of the extreme South:</p>

<p>I was lodged for some days in a small rustic inn whereto came,
in the evening, a dozen men of the planter class to spin yarns, smoke
and drink. They had all been Confederate soldiers&mdash;some of them
were the very remnants of war. Willingly they allowed the talk to
be led to the question as to the future of the black people. They
showed their interest in all the forms of trade schooling that could be
given them, and their contempt for the results of the literary education
which they have received. Repeated reference was made to the great
work that Booker Washington was doing at Tuskegee, and for it there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
was nothing but praise. One of the men dwelt with pleasure on the
fact that in the nearest large town two negroes, trained at Tuskegee,
were doing all the contract building, having ‘run out’ some cheap, ill-trained
whites who had long been in the business. This talk was
clearly not shaped for Northern ears, for the double reason that the
Southern folk are not in the least moved to such deception, and also
because I was with them as one of their own people. Very many such
occasions for learning the temper of the ex-slaveholder class have
convinced me that at present, and until the Southern conditions are
assimilated to those of the North, there will be no difficulty in developing
the technical skill of the blacks arising from the disinclination of
the people when they are thus employed. It is true that the old slaveholder,
with his care-taking humor towards the blacks, is passing away;
but his motives are likely to be continued in his descendants at least
for some generations.</p>

<p>There are at present in the South many thousand places for which
it would be easy to train negroes&mdash;places which would give them a
liberal education of the kind most needed by their race. It is not too
much to reckon that each year, in the development of the industries of
that region, adds some thousand chances which can not well be
filled from the native white people, but are likely to go to men brought
from elsewhere. Every opportunity to establish a family supported by
a skilled mechanic is of value. With even five per cent of the male
negroes thus employed, the prospects of their future would be greatly
benefited. The means for attaining this end are not difficult to find.
What is needed is an extension of the system followed at Tuskegee,
where youths are trained with the intent that they shall be made ready
for high-grade manual labor, the general schooling being limited to
what is necessary to ensure success in such practical work. A system
of trade schools for negroes, sufficient to supply the present demand
for skilled mechanics, is now the gravest need of the South.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the troops which are required for the
Federal service in tropical lands might well be recruited from the
negroes. It has indeed been proposed that these soldiers should be
permitted to take their families with them so that they might become
permanently and contentedly established in Luzon and elsewhere in the
colonies. There is no doubt but that the abler negroes, when properly
officered, make excellent soldiers&mdash;at least as infantry men. The experience
had with them during the Spanish War makes this point perfectly
clear. It may also be reckoned that they would endure tropical
climates better than the whites. It may further be said that the existence
of a large and well respected force of blacks in the Federal army
would unquestionably add to the social position of the negroes in the
estimation of both races. Again, the return of these men to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
homes, after their period of service, would be advantageous. Their
training and experience would make them of much value to their
people.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain signal disadvantages which would arise
from the employment of negroes as soldiers. In the first place, it would
tend to remove from the body of the folk the abler men&mdash;those to whom
we should mainly look for the uplifting of their race. This evil,
great in the case of all levies, would be most serious in this case; for
the reason that, while with white troops the rank and file are not
commonly by nature leaders of their society, they would be so with
black recruits. If the choice could be made of the Guinea type, this
loss would not be serious; but it certainly would fall to the more
militant stocks&mdash;those to which we have to look for advancement. In
the next place, we must see that the negro does not need the training
in passive obedience and mere order of life that the common soldier
receives. He has had that already in quite sufficient measure. He
now should have the lessons of individual responsibility&mdash;of control of
his life from within&mdash;lessons that civil life alone can give. Therefore,
the well-wisher of the race will be inclined to oppose this project
of recruiting our armies from the negroes of the Southern States. If
it is determined to enlist them it would be best to limit the age of
the recruits to about twenty years, and the period of active service to
five years, so that the men may be returned to civil life young enough
to enter on ordinary employments.</p>

<p>At present it is most desirable that the negroes of the South should
be induced to save money, for until that habit is formed, there is little
chance of lifting them in the economic scale or of developing in them
the business sense, which is one of the corner-stones of civilization. It
is probable that more could be done in the way of correcting the faults
and stimulating the latent capacities of the race by developing this
motive than by any other means. It is difficult to suggest any effective
system by which this end can be attained. The general conditions of
the South make rural savings-banks impossible. The receipts, at least
for many years, would be too small to render the business remunerative.
The only practicable method appears to be that of a Federal system
operated through the post-offices. The institution of such a system
appears to be justified by the two conditions: the exceeding need of
such a provision and the impossibility of doing the work except through
the postal machinery of which the Federal Government holds a monopoly.
It may be said that this method has proved successful under other
governments, and that it has been for some time established in Canada.
In our own country it is clearly demanded, in all rural communities,
though nowhere else so gravely as in the Southern States.</p>

<p>In looking over the latent possibilities of the negro people, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
observer can not fail to remark their keen delight in music. Statistics
on this, as on other facts, are lacking; but from what I have been able
to learn, it appears probable that a far greater proportion of the blacks
are sensitive to musical effects than is the case with the white people.
I have indeed never been able to find a black man who was so far lacking
in this sensibility that he did not enjoy the songs of his people. It is
not unlikely that close inquiry would show this to be a remarkable
feature in this unexplored race. As yet little effort has been made
to determine the true measure of this capacity of the negro for music.
It may be that they can not attain to the higher levels of the art; yet
it is perfectly evident that their voices are exceptionally good, and that
they have a keen native sense of time and tune. The most effective
dance music I have ever heard has been made by negroes who could not
read a note. When we consider how large a place music has in our life, it
is a fair suggestion that this quality of the black nature might well be
made the subject of experiment.</p>

<p>Those who look closely at the conditions of the negroes of the South
are led to the belief that the existing separation in sympathy of the
races is not likely long to continue. The greater number of the negroes
instinctively crave a protective relation with the whites. It is the
ancient disposition of the weak man to lean upon the strong which has
in all ages and lands determined the relations of folk. At present
the two peoples are held apart by the memories of slavery, rather than
by any real personal dislike&mdash;the race prejudice which so commonly
separates the Northern white from the negro. As this temporary
barrier wears down, we may hope to find a new form of association
arising&mdash;one in which the negroes will seek and find their friends
among the trusted men of the superior race. I have seen marks of this
new relation here and there, not many nor very clear, but fairly indicative
of what may come about, provided the political excitement is
allowed to subside and the people of the South, black and white, make
their adjustments according to their motives and capacities, with no
reference to the Federal power.</p>

<p>At first sight it will appear to most of the Northern people over-much
to ask that the powers at Washington give up all efforts to deal
with the needs of the negro folk&mdash;the so-called wards of the nation.
Yet experience has shown the impracticability of the project of helping
these negroes with the long arm of the Federal law. All that has
been undertaken in this way has been fruitless or worse. The only
chance for lifting the black man to the full status of the citizen is by
leaving his future essentially in the hands of the masterful folk who
alone can help him. We see that the ruling class in the South
have a measure of interest in the status of the negro and an opportunity
to benefit his state that can never belong to the people of the North.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Although the country, as a whole, will, of course, suffer from the failure
to elevate the blacks, the burden will lie most heavily on those
with whom they dwell.</p>

<p>The Southern whites have given evidence of political capacity of a
high order. Even their blunder in the rebellion is in good part compensated
for by the sagacity with which they accepted the results of the
war and turned them to the best account they could. They are not
likely to cower before the vast undertakings which the uplifting of the
blacks will entail; as yet, they have not accepted the task as their own.
They have indeed been brought to believe that their business was to defend
their own class interests, as well as they might be able to, against
the attacks of the negroes, aided by the Federal power. If they are
forced to see that within the limits the Federal Constitution sets to
action, the responsibility for the future of their several States is in the
hands of those who control their politics, we may hope to find the
political and economic skill which went to the development of the
system of slavery given to the advancement of the Africans. While
the work must needs be done by the men who are near to it, it should
receive every possible aid and sympathy from those who, because they
are far away, can not effectively control the matter. The cause is so
large that it needs the help of all who wish it well.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the time has come for an effective union of
endeavor on the part of those of North and South, ex-slaveholder and
ex-abolitionist alike, who wish to see the negro have, not his rights in
the common sense of the word (for mere rights are a pitiful share for
a man), but rather a good human chance to climb the ladder of civilization,
upon which our ancestors set him. The aims of these two ancient
parties surely have for a common end the best that can be done for the
negro people. It is just as much a mistake to suppose that the majority
of the slaveholders in a malign spirit sought to oppress and torture the
blacks, as to fancy that the abolitionists desired to set the negroes over
their sometime masters; for history will probably write it down that the
better men of these two parties were both dealing with the same very
difficult problem: that their contentions grew from a failure on both
sides to see the whole of the matter.</p>

<p>It is possible that something might be done to help towards effective
work, looking to the end we have in view, through a society for the
study of the African problem. Such an association, provided it included
men who were guided by a true spirit of inquiry and had no
political ends to win, especially if it was in part made up of Southerners
who had a large-minded view of the matter, could do much to guide
action in profitable ways. In general, I am opposed to the increase in
the number of societies; so that, if there be any in existence that could
fairly undertake this task, I should prefer to see it set about the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
I am not aware, however, that there is any existing association which
includes such questions in its field of inquiry.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the suggestions I have made concerning the
immediate needs of the negro do not include any mention of the higher
scholastic education. This is not because I disbelieve in such training
for those blacks who, by their evident capacity, show that it fits them;
but because it seems futile at the present time to waste efforts in giving
these people an education for which they are in general by no means
ready&mdash;which, if attained, does not afford them a way to a suitable station.
The few youths of the race who really desire what is commonly
called a college education, are reasonably certain to receive it in some
one of the many schools where they are sure of a welcome and of all
due help. Even in the case of those blacks who, by some rare chance,
have inherited the proper foundations of the higher mental training, and
are made ready for the so-called professions, I see but a very poor chance
of advancement to any fit positions in this country. Even in the
part of the North where one would expect these well-trained negroes
would have a fair chance in life, it does not avail them. As physicians,
lawyers, clergymen or engineers they can look forward to no future
having a definite relation to their capacities. They can not expect to
have any range of social opportunities, and their employment will have
to be essentially with their own people.</p>

<p>The youth of negro blood might naturally expect to find in a community
devoted to the maintenance of his rights at least a welcome to
the external business society. He will, however, find that the people
who would willingly sacrifice much to ensure him an equal place in
matters political, allow their race prejudices or those of their associates
to deny him fair play. It is a lamentable fact that this dislike to these
men of the other aspect is far stronger in the North than in the South.
In the parts of the North where negroes are rare, there is, it is true,
a sense of duty by them that ensures their place before the law; but not
enough personal contact with them to wear away the first offence of
their diverse aspect. In most parts of the Southern States the black
man is so constantly in view that the instinctive prejudice is worn away&mdash;he
is perhaps, in a somewhat contemptuous way, personally liked.
The race prejudice takes the form of certain rules of intercourse, expressing
about the feeling that separates the commissioned officers and
the enlisted men of an army. There is an element of truth in the statement,
attributed to Thomas Carlyle, that the Northern man said, “God
d&mdash;d you, Sambo, be free;” and the Southerner, “God bless you, Sambo,
be slave.” The result to Sambo is the same&mdash;a deprivation of opportunities
in all the higher walks of life.</p>

<p>The only safe way up for the negro appears to lie in the industrial
field, in mechanical employments, where his race may not weigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
against him, and where head and hands may help one another to profit
of mind and pocket&mdash;in business of varied kinds where he may get
money, and with it the station that, in the common view, nothing else
will afford him; in good work done for his race such as will give him
the dignity in the eyes of all men that the master of Tuskegee has
won. It is very much better for a negro youth, and for his race, that
he should be a successful blacksmith, farmer or engineer, than a lawyer
or physician, hindered and shunned, sorely burthened as he is sure to be
by the cross that his fellowmen force him to bear. Therefore, unless
they are willing to betake themselves to countries where the government
is in the control of mixed peoples, thereby escaping the worst
evils of race prejudice, it seems best for negroes not to seek the so-called
learned professions, but to win their way on the lines where they will
find less resistance&mdash;on ways quite fit for a man, even if not the highest.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that our colonies may afford a field for professionally
educated negroes; but there, if they are to be ruled by the
home government, it is likely that they will find a white caste in control.
We may thus expect that the same essential disfranchisement
will be found there as at home. Moreover, as before remarked, this
project of sending to far lands the individual of ability who is needed
at home, can not commend itself to those who feel the need which is
with us, a need that calls for all the capacity we can hope to develop
among the black people. It is clearly not a time to consider a proposition
to export these abler youths of the black population.</p>

<p>Back of all our projects to bring the negroes of the South to the
full station of citizens, to get rid of the contempt and the consequences
of the contempt in which they are, as a race, so generally held, is the
grave question as to the practicability of framing a social and political
system in which men of such diverse origin may have a substantially
equal chance. It must be granted that in no modern state of high
grade has this problem been fairly solved. The instances from the
tropical colonies of Great Britain are not really apposite; but there
seems no fundamental difficulty to contend with in order to attain this
end. With cultivated people of their own race about them the better
negro youth would not be deprived of that element of education. We
have taken into our political family races scarcely less different in
motives from our own than are the negroes, making no kind of objection
to their sharing the commonwealth with us. In certain ways it is
true that a nation loses strength where it fails to have its elements
closely knit together. But it may be doubted whether these losses are
not more than compensated for by the gains that arise from diversities
such as would come from the introduction into our system of a body
of folk with the capacities which our Africans are likely with thorough
training to develop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
In this matter there are but two courses open to us&mdash;one of folly,
the other of wisdom. We may leave the black people to work out
their own salvation as best they may, to lie as a mass at the bottom
of our society, except so far as the abler men who may arise among them
help their struggling fellows. The result of this will be the perpetuation
of all the existing evils. Or we may set to work, after the true
manner of our folk, with the full knowledge that the task is very
great, but that we have the strength to see it done. With this spirit
we may accomplish the noblest work that men have ever undertaken
in any nation.</p>

<p>To the people of the South we may fairly say: “These negroes were
brought here by your forefathers, and thus tied to the land. In their
training as slaves, they were given an opportunity to rise far above their
primitive savagery. You have seen in serious trials how, as a race,
they are trustworthy. They are now your fellow-citizens in name, but
are in a condition to be a permanent menace to your commonwealth.
Properly aided on their way upward, they may be of great value to
your descendants.” To the people of the North we may plead for all
the help they can give; for hardly less than the Southerners, their ancestors
shared in the actions which brought the negroes to this country.
They gave the blacks the semblance of citizenship by the process of
emancipation. If the work stops there, it may be questioned whether it
was a boon to the masses of the folk it made nominally free. To be
what it was meant to be, then, it needs more than enactments. There
must be long continued and devoted labor, wisely directed.</p>

<p>A necessary part of the work of a true emancipation of the negro
is a careful inquiry into the history and former status of the people.
Such an inquiry, placed and kept in good hands, is a necessary preliminary
to sagacious action. It may serve to unite the men of all
parts of the country in a work that so nearly concerns us all. There is
not, nor is there likely to arise, a situation that so calls for intelligent
patriotism as this we are sorely neglecting. We may go far away
and rear an empire with our armies; but if we leave these, our neighbors,
without a fair chance to develop the good that is in them, we shall
have lost our real opportunity for great deeds&mdash;mayhap we shall fix
among us evils that in the end will drag us down.</p>

<h2 title="The Physical Geography of the Lands" id="physical">THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE LANDS.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Professor W. M. Davis.</span><br />

<span class="small">HARVARD UNIVERSITY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> most important principles established in physical geography
during the nineteenth century are that the description of the
earth’s surface features must be accompanied by explanation, and that
the surface features must be correlated with their inhabitants. During
the establishment of these evolutionary principles, exploration at home
and abroad has greatly increased the store of recorded facts; the more
civilized countries have been in large part measured and mapped; the
coasts of the world have been charted; the less civilized continents
have been penetrated to their centers. This harvest of fact has been an
indispensable stimulus to the study of physical geography; yet it can
not be doubted that the spirit which has given life to the letter of the
subject is the principle of evolution&mdash;inorganic and organic. This is
especially true of the geography of the lands.</p>

<p>The century has seen the measurement of higher peaks in the Himalayas
than had been previously measured in the Andes. The Nile has
been traced to its source in the lakes of equatorial Africa, verifying the
traditions of the ancients; and the Kongo has been found to cross
the equator twice on its way to the sea. Facts without number have
been added to the previous sum of knowledge. But at the same time, it
has been discovered that the valleys of mountain ranges are the work of
erosion; that the product of valley erosion is often seen in extensive
piedmont fluviatile plains; that waterfalls are retrogressively worn away
until they are reduced to the smooth grade of a maturely established
river; and that interior basins are slowly filling with the waste that is
washed in from their rims upon their floors. Here are explanatory
generalizations, involving, yet going far beyond matter of direct observation.
Such generalizations in geography correspond to the recognition
in astronomy that planetary movements exemplify the law of
gravitation; they are the Newton as against the Kepler of the subject.</p>

<p>The sufficient justification of the demand that has now arisen for explanation
and correlation in the study of land forms is found in the
repeated experience that until an explanatory description of a region
can be given, one may be sure that some of its significant elements
pass unnoticed; and until the controls that it exerts on living forms are
studied, one may be confident that its geographical value is but half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
measured. A sentence from Guyot’s Earth and Man may here be
taken as a guide: “To describe, without rising to the causes, or descending
to the consequences, is no more science than merely and
simply to relate a fact of which one has been a witness.” There could
hardly be devised a more concise and searching test of good work than
this quotation suggests. The causes, in so far as the physical geography
of the lands is concerned, have been learned chiefly through the study
of geology; yet it does not by any means follow that all geologists
are possessed of such knowledge of these causes as will constitute them
geographers. The consequences have been learned through the study
of evolutionary biology; yet a distinct addition to the usual discipline
of biology is required in order to apprehend its geographical correlations.
The limited space allowed to this article will require that
further consideration of the consequences be excluded, in order to give
due consideration to the causes.</p>

<p>One of the preparatory steps in the century’s advance was taken
by the German geographer, Ritter, who, near the beginning of the century,
advocated a new principle that may be illustrated by the change
in the definition of geography from “the description of the earth and its
inhabitants” to “the study of the earth in relation to its inhabitants;”
but advance beyond this beginning was for a long time obstructed by
certain ancient beliefs. Theological preconceptions as to the age of the
earth and the associated geological doctrine of catastrophism, although
attacked by the rising school of uniformitarianism, were then dominant.
They gave to the geographer a ready-made earth, on which the
existing processes of change were unimportant. Furthermore, the belief
in the separate creation of every organic species led to the doctrine
of teleology, which maintained the predetermined fitness of the earth
for its inhabitants, and of its inhabitants for their lifework. All this
had to be outgrown before geographers could understand the slow development
of land forms and the progressive adaptation of all living
beings to their environments. Yet the beginning that Ritter made was
of great importance, and it would have led further had it not happened
that for many decades professors of geography in Europe brought
chiefly a historical training to their chairs, to the almost entire neglect
of physical geography. In the last thirty years there has been a reaction
from this condition in Germany and France, but Italy, with
many professors of geography in her universities, still for the most part
follows historical methods.</p>

<p>In the victory of the uniformitarians over the catastrophists began
the fortunate alliance of geography with geology, which was long afterwards
happily phrased by Mackinder: “Geology considers the past in
the light of the present; geography considers the present in the light
of the past.” Instead of believing in cataclysmic upheavals and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
overwhelming floods, Playfair and other exponents of the Huttonian
school taught that mountains were slowly upheaved and slowly worn
down. The simplicity of Playfair’s argument finds excellent illustration
in the often quoted passage regarding the origin of valleys: “Every
river appears to consist of a main trunk, fed from a variety of branches,
each running in a valley proportioned to its size, and all of them together
forming a system of vallies, communicating with one another,
and having such a nice adjustment of their declivities that none of them
join the principal valley either on too high or too low a level; a circumstance
which would be infinitely improbable if each of these vallies were
not the work of the stream that flows in it.” Descriptions of valleys
should always recognize the share that rivers have had in eroding them,
or else the “nice adjustment of their declivities” may pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that to this day explanation is not
always allowed an undisputed place in the treatment of the lands, however
fully it is accepted as appropriate to the presentation of other
divisions of physical geography. But the manner in which explanation
is extending over a larger and larger part of the subject gives
assurance that the geographers of the coming century will insist upon a
uniformly rational treatment of all divisions of their science. The
active phenomena of the earth’s surface first secured explanation; it
has long been considered essential to explain as well as to describe
such phenomena as the winds of the air and the currents of the ocean;
indeed, this is now so habitual that many geographers who may object
to the explanation of a peculiar kind of a valley as a trespass upon
geology, will nevertheless demand an explanation of rainfall and tides,
although these truly geographical subjects are manifestly shared with
physics and astronomy. Land forms of very elementary character, like
deltas, or of rapid production, like volcanoes, have had to give some
account of themselves all through the century; but it was not for many
years after the announcement of Playfair’s law, that the erosion of valleys
by the rivers that drain them came to be regarded as a subject
appropriate to a geographical treatise. Only in the later years of the
century has the fuller treatment of this beautiful subject been attempted;
even now much of it remains to be developed in the century to
come.</p>

<p>The treatment of physical geography will be much more even, to
the great advantage of its students, when explanatory description is applied
to all its parts. The alluvial fans at the base of arid mountains
should be accounted for as well as the dunes of deserts. The fault
cliffs of broken plateau blocks and the weathered cliffs of retreating
escarpments deserve to be considered as carefully as the wave-cut cliffs
of coasts; the essential differences of these forms are reached most
easily through their explanation. The varied sculpturing of a mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
slope may, in time, come to be as well understood as is now the
erosion of a simple valley in a low plain.</p>

<p>One of the most notable elements of the century’s progress is the
increasing breadth of view gained as explanatory descriptions are extended
further and further over the geographical field. At first explanation
was given to various individual features, item by item; now
it is recognized that an appropriate place must be provided for all
kinds of land forms in a comprehensive scheme of physiographic classification.
Many instances of the earlier stage might be given, beginning
with examples from the works of Humboldt, the acknowledged leader of
scientific explorers in the opening decades of the century. His
attempts, more or less completely successful, to explain the facts that
he observed, as well as to correlate life with environment, may be
traced all through his writings; but his ‘Cosmos’ (1845) did not
reach a careful discussion of land forms, although it entered so far into
an explanatory treatment as to consider the formation of mountain
ranges.</p>

<p>Innumerable examples of isolated facts and special explanations,
unrelated to a comprehensive scheme of physiographic classification,
might be taken from the reports of exploring expeditions and of geological
surveys; from books of travel and from geographical and geological
journals with which the nineteenth century has filled so many
library shelves; but lack of space will prevent mention of all sources,
save a few treatises in which the accumulated knowledge of their time
is summarized. Such a work as Mrs. Somerville’s ‘Physical Geography’
(1848) gives in the early pages a brief general consideration of land
forms, and then enters at once upon the areal description of the continents;
later pages present a short outline of the features of rivers, and
then the rivers of the world are taken up. This is as if a text-book of
botany should pass rapidly over the structure and classification of
plants, and devote most of its pages to the flora of different regions.
Again, Klöden’s compendious geography includes a volume on ‘Physical
Geography,’ in which much material is gathered (3d ed., 1873); but the
treatment is very uneven, as is natural in the absence of a good scheme
of classification. Glaciers receive much attention, but valleys are
rather curtly dismissed; deltas are elaborately described, but little
space is given to other forms assumed by the waste of the land on the
way to the sea. Ansted’s ‘Physical Geography’ (5th ed., 1871) contains
abundant fact, but much of it is a kind that is better presented on a
map than in verbal form. Many pages are devoted to statistical statements,
from which no student can gain inspiration for further study,
for example: “The Danube receives a large number of tributaries, of
which the most important are, on the right, the Isar, Inn, Raab, Drave,
Save, Morave, and Isker. On the left are the Altmühl, Regen, Waag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Gran, Theiss, Temes, Aluta, Sereth, and Pruth. Many of these are large
streams with other important tributaries. The Danube drains upwards
of 300,000 square miles of country.”</p>

<p>A decided advance over earlier books in the way of rational or
explanatory treatment is found in the works of Peschel and Reclus; it
is to the former that a reaction against the historical treatment of
geography in Germany is largely due; while the latter is to be credited
with an enlarged attention to the detail of land forms; but the books of
neither of these authors recognize the systematic evolution of land
forms. The same may be said of various other treatises which approach,
but do not yet reach, the ideal that seems to be in sight. One of the
chief responsibilities of the geographer&mdash;the description of landscape&mdash;can
not be fully met by students who accept the principles set forth in
these books as their guides; for in spite of the increasing attention
given to the lands in modern books, and in spite of the greater number
of forms recognized, the combination of all forms in a well-organized
whole is not yet accomplished.</p>

<p>It seems to have been against the empirical method of such books as
Ansted’s that Huxley protested in his ‘Physiography,’ urging its replacement
by a more educative method. He wrote:</p>

<p>“I do not think that a description of the earth, which commences
by telling a child that it is an oblate spheriod, moving around the sun
in an elliptical orbit, and ends without giving him the slightest hint
towards an understanding of the ordnance map of his own country, or
any suggestion as to the meaning of the phenomena offered by the
brook which runs through his village, or of the gravel pit whence the
roads are mended, is calculated either to interest or to instruct....
Physiography has very little to do with this sort of Physical Geography.
My hearers were not troubled with much about latitudes and
longitudes, the heights of mountains, depths of seas, or the geographical
distribution of kangaroos or <i>Compositae</i>.... I endeavored to
give them ... a view of the ‘place in nature’ of a particular
district of England&mdash;the basin of the Thames&mdash;and to leave upon their
minds the impression that the muddy waters of our metropolitan river,
the hills between which it flows, the breezes which blow over it, are not
isolated phenomena, to be taken as understood because they are familiar.
On the contrary, I endeavored to show that the application of the
plainest and simplest processes of reasoning to any one of these
phenomena suffices to show, lying behind it, a cause, which again suggests
another; until, step by step, the conviction dawns upon the learner
that, to attain to even an elementary conception of what goes on in his
own parish, he must know something about the universe; that the
pebble he kicks aside would not be what it is and where it is, unless
a particular chapter of the earth’s history, finished untold ages ago, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
been exactly what it was.... Many highly valuable compendia
of Physical Geography, for the use of scientific students of that subject,
are extant; but in my judgment most of the elementary works I
have seen begin at the wrong end, and too often terminate in an
<i>ominum gatherum</i> of scraps of all sorts of undigested and unconnected
information; thereby entirely destroying the educational value of that
study which Kant justly termed the ‘propædeutic of natural knowledge.’”
(Preface to ‘Physiography,’ 1878).</p>

<p>Here we find clear recognition of the need of introducing a consideration
of causes, just as was urged by Guyot; and furthermore a
recognition of the need of linking together in their natural relations all
the items which together constitute the content of the subject. It
may, however, be contended that the attempt to combine in a single
course of study the elementary principles of chemistry and physics, of
geology and astronomy, along with those of physical geography, is not
practicable from an educational point of view; such a combination will
not secure either the clear knowledge or the strong discipline that can
be derived from systematic courses in two or three of these subjects,
presented separately. Text-books like Hinman’s ‘Eclectic Physical
Geography’ and Mill’s ‘Realm of Nature,’ in both of which a broad
range of other than geographical subjects is covered, do not seem to-day
to be in so much favor as those books which attend more closely to the
true content of our subject. Indeed, with respect to physical geography,
considered from the scientific and educational point of view, a
report on College Entrance Requirements, recently published by our
National Educational <span class="locked">Association,<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a></span> presents the best definition and outline
of the subject that has yet appeared. It advises the omission of
irrelevant matter, however interesting such matter may be in itself.
The principles of physics and the succession of geological formations
with their fossils, the classification and distribution of plants and
animals must be taught elsewhere; but much profit may be had from
terrestrial phenomena by which the principles of physics are illustrated,
and from the consequences of past geological changes in determining
present geographical conditions, and especially from the physiographic
controls by which the distribution of organic forms is determined.</p>

<p>The general scheme under which all land forms may receive explanatory
description must consider chiefly the movement and erosion
of the earth’s crust. Deformation offers a part of the earth’s crust
to be worked upon. Various destructive processes of erosion work
upon the offered mass, and the streams, with their transported waste,
follow the depressions in the carved surface. So important is the element
of erosion, and so leading is the part played by rivers in erosive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
work, that McGee would gather all land forms under a classification
determined by their drainage <span class="locked">systems.<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></span> Others have preferred a classification
based, first on peculiarities of structure as determined by accumulation
and deformation; and, secondly, on the progress of erosion;
but in either scheme, the erosive work of rivers is so important that a
sketch of the progress of the physical geography of the lands towards a
systematic classification of its items may well follow the order in which
valleys have been explained, branching off, as occasion may require,
from the leading theme of rivers that flow under a normal humid
climate to special conditions of erosion under an arid or a frigid climate.
The progress which has made the physical geography of the lands what
it is to-day is more the work of geologists than of geographers; and
the chief reason for this is the indifference of many geographers to the
physical side of their subject; an indifference that was undoubtedly
favored by the cultivation of historical geography in continental Europe,
and by the acceptance of the traveler or explorer as a full-fledged
geographer in Great Britain. In the United States, it is only in the
latter part of the century that the physical geography of the lands has
gained a scientific standing, and the advantages that it now enjoys
are geographical grafts upon a geological stock.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E" id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> <i>Nat. Geogr. Magazine</i>, i, 1889, 27&ndash;36.</p></div>

<p>The emancipation of geology from the doctrine of catastrophism
was a necessary step before progress could be made towards an understanding
of the lands. The slow movements of elevation and depression
of certain coasts in historic time were of great importance in this
connection. Studies of geological structures at last overcame the belief
in the sudden and violent upheaval of mountain chains, which, under
the able and authoritative advocacy of Elie de Beaumont, held a place
even into the second half of the century. But even when it came to
be understood that mountains and plateaus have been slowly upheaved,
it still remained to be proved that the valleys and canyons by which
they are drained were produced by erosion, and not by fractures and
unequal movements of elevation. Advance was here made on two
lines. Along one, a better understanding was gained of the forms
producible by deformation alone; along the other, sea currents, floods
and earthquake waves, to which the earlier observers trusted as a means
of modifying the forms of uplift, were gradually replaced by the slow
action of weather and water. Processes of deformation were found to
act in a large way, producing massive forms without detail&mdash;broad
plains and plateaus, extensive domes, straight cliffs and rolling corrugations;
and thus it was learned that the varied and detailed forms of
lofty mountain ranges and dissected plateaus must be ascribed almost
entirely to the processes of erosion. But it should be noted that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
exceptional instances land forms initiated by deformation, so recently
as to have suffered as yet only insignificant sculpture, may exhibit much
irregularity. The most striking example of this kind, an example of
the very highest value in the systematic study of land forms, is that
afforded by the diversely tilted lava blocks of Southern Oregon, as
described by <span class="locked">Russell.<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F" id="Footnote_F" href="#FNanchor_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> 4th <i>Ann. Rep. U. S. Geol. Survey</i>, 1883.</p></div>

<p>Turning now to the second line of advance, it is noteworthy that so
keen an observer as Lesley insisted, as late as 1856, that the peculiar
topographical features of Pennsylvania, which he knew and described
so well, could have been produced only by a great flood. But the
principles of the uniformitarians were constantly gaining ground
against these older ideas; and after the appearance in England of
Scrope’s studies in Central France and of Greenwood’s polemic
little work on ‘Rain and Rivers’ (1857), victory may be said to have
been declared for the principles long before announced by Hutton and
Playfair, which, since then, have obtained general acceptance and application.</p>

<p>Yet even the most ardent uniformitarians would, in the middle of
the century, go no further than to admit that rain and rivers could
roughen a region by carving valleys in it; no consideration was then
given to the possibility that, with longer and longer time, the hills must
be more and more consumed, the valleys must grow wider and wider
open, until, however high and uneven the initial surface may have been,
it must at last be reduced to a lowland of small relief. The surface of
such a lowland would truncate the underground structures indifferently;
but when such truncating surfaces were noticed (usually now at considerable
altitudes above sea level, as if elevated after having been
planed, and therefore more or less consumed by the erosion of a new
system of valleys), they were called plains of marine denudation by
Ramsay (1847), or plains of marine abrasion by Richthofen (1882).
Today it is recognized that both subaërial erosion and marine abrasion
are theoretically competent to produce lowlands of denudation; the
real question here at issue concerns the criteria by which the work of
either agency can be recognized in particular instances. In the middle
of the century, not only every plain of denudation, but every line of
escarpments was held by the marinists to be the work of sea waves; and
it was not till after a sharp debate that the bluffs of the chalk downs
which enclose the Weald of southeastern England were accepted as the
product of ordinary atmospheric weathering, instead of as the work
of the sea. Whitaker’s admirable essay on ‘Subaërial Denudation,’
which may be regarded as having given the victory in this discussion to
the subaërialists, was considered so heterodox that it was not acceptable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
for publication in the <i>Quarterly Journal</i> of the Geological Society, of
London, but had to find a place in the more modest <i>Geological Magazine</i>
(1867), whose pages it now honors. So signal indeed was this
victory that, in later years, the destructive work of the sea has been
not infrequently underrated in the almost exclusive attention given to
land sculpture by subaërial agencies. Truly, the sea does not erode valleys;
it does not wear out narrow lowlands of irregular form between
enclosing uplands, as was maintained by some of the most pronounced
marinists in the middle of the century; but it certainly does attack
continental borders in a most vigorous fashion, and many are the
littoral forms that must be ascribed to its work, as may be learned from
Richthofen’s admirable ‘Führer für Forschungsreisende’ (1886). As
this problem can not be further considered here, the reader may be
at once referred to the most general discussion of the subject that has
yet appeared, in an essay on ‘Shoreline Topography’ recently published
by F.&nbsp;P. <span class="locked">Gulliver.<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>At about the time when the subaërial origin of valleys and escarpments
was being established in England, the explorations and surveys
of our western territories were undertaken, and a flood of physiographic
light came from them. One of the earliest and most important
of the many lessons of the West was that Playfair’s law obtained even
in the case of the Grand canyon of the Colorado, which was visited
by the Ives expedition in 1858. Newberry, the geologist of the expedition,
concluded that both the deep and fissure-like canyon and the
broader valleys enclosed by cliff-like walls “belong to a vast system
of erosion, and are wholly due to the action of water.” Although he
bore the possibility of fractures constantly in mind and examined the
structure of the canyons with all possible care, he “everywhere found
evidence of the exclusive action of water in their formation.” This
conclusion has, since then, been amply confirmed by Powell and Dutton,
although these later observers might attribute a significant share
of the recession of cliffs in arid regions to wind action. In a later
decade, Heim demonstrated that the valleys of the Alps were not
explicable as the result of mountain deformation, and that they found
explanation only in river erosion. By such studies as these, of which
many examples could be given, the competence of rivers to carve even
the deepest valleys has been fully established; yet so difficult is it to
dislodge old-fashioned belief that Sir A. Geikie felt it necessary to
devote two chapters in his admirable ‘Scenery of Scotland’ (1887) to
prove that the bens of the Highlands were not so many individual
upheavals, but that the glens were so many separate valleys of erosion;
and as able an observer as Prestwich, a warm advocate of the erosion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
of ordinary valleys by their rivers, maintained (1886), with the results
of our western surveys before him, that fissures were probably responsible
for the origin of the deep and narrow canyons of the Colorado
plateau.</p>

<p>The tumultuous forms of lofty mountains ‘tossed up’ as they seem
to be when viewed from some commanding height, are, in by far the
greater number of examples yet studied, undoubtedly the result of the
slow erosion of the valleys between them; but it should not be forgotten
that regions of very recent disturbances&mdash;as the earth counts
time&mdash;may possess strong inequalities directly due to deformation.
The tilted lava blocks of Oregon have already been mentioned. The
bold forms of the St. Elias Alps, also described by Russell, are regarded
by him as chiefly produced by the tilting of huge crustal blocks on
which erosion has as yet done relatively little work. An altogether
exceptional case is described by Dutton, who says that on the margin
of one of the “high plateaus of Utah a huge block seems to have
cracked off and rolled over, the beds opening with a V and forming a
valley of grand dimensions.” ‘Rift valleys,’ or trough-like depressions
produced by the down-faulting of long, narrow, crustal blocks with respect
to the bordering masses, are occasionally found, as in eastern
Africa, where the ‘Great Rift valley’ has been described by Gregory.
Trough-like depressions of similar origin, but much more affected by
the degradation of their borders and the aggradation of their floors,
are known to European geographers in the valleys of the Saône and of
the middle Rhine. But no rift valley, no depression between the tilted
lava blocks, resembles the branching valleys that are produced by the
erosive action of running water.</p>

<p>Thus far, while much attention had been given to the work of rivers,
little or no attention had been given to the arrangement of their
courses. It seems to have been tacitly assumed that the courses of all
streams were consequent upon the slope of the initial land surface.
The explicit recognition of this origin, indicated by the provision of a
special name, ‘consequent streams,’ was an important step in advance
due to our western geologists. The discovery soon followed that rivers
have held their courses through mountain ridges that slowly rose across
their path; the rivers, concentrating the drainage of a large headwater
region upon a narrow line, cut down their channels as the land was
raised. This idea first came into prominence through Powell’s report
on the Colorado River of the West (1875), in which he gave the name,
‘antecedent,’ to rivers of this class. He believed that the Green river,
in its passage through the Uinta mountains, was to be explained as an
antecedent stream. Much doubt has, however, been thrown upon this
interpretation. Other accounts of antecedent rivers have been published,
and to-day the Green is not so safe a type of antecedence as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the Rhine below Bingen, the Meuse in the Ardennes, or several of the
Himalayan rivers in the gorges that they have cut through the youngest
marginal ridges of the range.</p>

<p>Rapidly following the establishment of these two important classes
of valleys came the recognition of the very antithesis of antecedent
rivers in those streams which have grown by headward erosion along
belts of weak structure, without relation to the initial trough lines.
To these the term ‘subsequent’ has been applied. It is frequently
in association with streams of this class that drainage areas are rearranged
by the migration of divides, and that the upper waters of
one river are captured by the headward growth of another. This is
accomplished by a most beautiful process of inorganic natural selection,
which leads to a survival of the fittest and thus brings about a most
intimate adjustment of form to structure, whereby the more resistent
rock masses come to constitute the divides, and the less resistent are
chosen for the excavation of valleys. Many workers have contributed
to the solution of problems of this class; notably Heim, in his studies
of the northern Alps (1876), and Löwl, who showed that, in folded
mountain structures of great age, the original courses of streams might
be greatly altered through the development of new lines of drainage
(1882). A valuable summary of this subject is given by Philippson in
his ‘Studien über Wasserscheiden’ (1886). The extraordinary depredations
committed by the waxing Severn on the waning Thames
have recently been set forth by Buckman. The turning of side
branches from the slender trunk of the Meuse has been recognized in
France. Many remarkable instances of stream captures have been
found in the Appalachians, where the opportunity for the adjustment
of streams to structures has been exceptionally good. Hayes and
Campbell have, on the other hand, emphasized the importance of drainage
modifications independent of the growth of subsequent streams on
weak structures, but governed by a slight tilting of the region, whereby
some streams are accelerated and their opponents are retarded. It
should be noted that the proof of the adjustment or rearrangement of
drainage marks a victory for the uniformitarian school that is even
more significant than that gained in the case of the antecedent rivers;
for in one case a growing mountain range is subdued by the concentrated
discharge of a large drainage area; but in the other case, the
mountain slowly melts away under the attacks of the weather alone on
the headwater slopes of the growing valleys.</p>

<p>The reason why all these studies of land carving are of importance to
the geographer is that they greatly enlarge the number of type forms
that he may use in descriptions, and that they recognize the natural
correlations among various forms which must otherwise be set forth
in successive itemized statements. The brief terminology learned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
early school days, somewhat enlarged by a more mature variety of adjectives,
is usually the stock of words with which the explorer tries to
reproduce the features of the landscapes that he crosses, and as a result
his descriptions are often unintelligible; the region has to be explored
again before it can become known to those who do not see it. The
longitudinal relief of certain well-dissected coastal plains, or the half-buried
ranges of certain interior aggraded basins, may be taken as
examples of forms which are easily brought home and familiarized by
explanation, but which commonly remain remote and unknown under
empirical description.</p>

<p>It may be urged that in many geological discussions from which
geography has taken profit, consideration is given to form-producing
processes rather than to the forms produced. This was natural enough
while the subject was in the hands of geologists; but geographers
should take heed that they do not preserve the geological habit. The
past history of land forms and the action upon them of various processes
by which existing forms have been developed, are pertinent to
geography only in so far as they aid the observation and description of
the forms of to-day.</p>

<p>Further illustration of the growing recognition of form as the chief
object of the physiographic study of the lands is seen in the use of the
term, ‘geomorphology’ by some American writers; but more important
than the term is the principle which underlies it. This is the acceptance
of theorizing as an essential part of investigation in geography,
just as in other sciences. All explanation involves theorizing. When
theory is taken piecemeal and applied only to elementary problems,
such as the origin of deltas, it does not excite unfavorable comment
among geographers. But when the explanation of more complicated
features is attempted, and when a comprehensive scheme of classification
and treatment, in which theorizing is fully and frankly recognized,
is evolved for all land forms, then the conservatives recoil, as if so bold
a proposition would set them adrift on the dangerous sea of unrestrained
imagination. They forget that the harbor of explanation can
only be reached by crossing the seas of theory. They are willing to
cruise, like the early navigators, the empirical explorers, only close
along shore; not venturing to trust themselves out of sight of the land
of existing fact; but they have not learned to embark upon the open
ocean of investigation, trusting to the compass of logical deduction and
the rudder of critical judgment to lead them to the desired haven of
understanding of facts of the past.</p>

<p>One of the bolder explorers of the high seas of theory is Powell,
who defined in the term ‘baselevel’ an idea that had long been more
or less consciously present in the minds of geologists, and which has
been since then of the greatest service to physiographers. Powell and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
his followers, especially Gilbert, Dutton and McGee, have consistently
carried the consequences of subaërial erosion to their legitimate end in a
featureless lowland, and have recognized the controlling influence of the
baselevel during all the sequence of changes from the initial to the ultimate
form. It is not here essential whether such a featureless lowland
exists or ever has existed, but it is absolutely essential to follow the lead
of deduction until all the consequences of the theory of erosion are
found; and then to accept as true those theoretical deductions which
successfully confront the appropriate facts of observation. Only in this
way can the error of regarding geography as a purely observational
natural science be corrected. Following the acceptance of the doctrine
of baselevels came the method of reconstituting the original form initiated
by deformation, as a means of more fully understanding the
existing form; for only by beginning at the initial form can the systematic
sequence of the changes wrought by destructive processes be
fully traced and the existing form appreciated. This had often been
done before in individual cases, but it now became a habit, an essential
step in geomorphological study. Naturally enough, the terms of organic
growth, such as young, mature, old, revived, and so on, came to
be applied to stages in the development of inorganic forms; and thus
gradually the idea of the systematic physiographic development of land
forms has taken shape. This idea is to-day the most serviceable and
compact summation of all the work of the century on the physical
geography of the lands. It recognizes the results of deformation in
providing the broader initial forms on which details are to be carved.
It gives special attention to the work of destructive processes on these
forms, and especially to the orderly sequence of various stages of development,
recognizing that certain features are associated with youth,
and others with maturity and old age. It gives due consideration to
the renewed movements of deformation that may occur at any stage in
the cycle of change, whereby a new sequence of change is introduced.
It gives appropriate place, not only to the forms produced by the ordinary
erosive action of rain and rivers, but to the forms produced by ice
and by wind action as well; and it co-ordinates the changes that are produced
by the sea on the margin of the land with the changes that are
produced by other agencies upon its surface. It considers not only
the various forms assumed by the water of the land, such as torrents,
rapids, falls and lakes, appropriately arranged in a river system as
to time and place, but also the forms assumed by the waste of the land,
which, like the water, is on its way to the sea. In a word, it lengthens
our own life, so that we may, in imagination, picture the life of a
geographical area as clearly as we now witness the life of a quick-growing
plant, and thus as readily conceive and as little confuse the
orderly development of the many parts of a land form, its divides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
cliffs, slopes and water courses, as we now distinguish the cotyledons,
stem, buds, leaves, flowers and fruit of a rapidly-maturing annual that
produces all these forms in appropriate order and position in the brief
course of a single summer.</p>

<p>The time is ripe for the introduction of these ideas. The spirit of
evolution has been breathed by the students of the generation now
mature all through their growing years and its application to all lines
of study is demanded. It is true that the acceptance of inorganic as
well as of organic evolution is often implied rather than outspoken; yet
evolution is favorably regarded, as is proved by the eagerness with
which even school boards and school teachers, conservatives among
conservatives, hail the appearance of books in which the new spirit
of geography is revealed. In the last years of the century, the school
books most widely used in this country have made great advance in the
explanatory treatment of land forms. Tarr’s Physical Geographies and
Russell’s monographic volumes on the ‘Lakes,’ ‘Glaciers,’ ‘Volcanoes’
and ‘Rivers’ of North America, all presenting land forms in an explanatory
rather than an empirical manner, have been warmly welcomed in
this country. Penck’s ‘Morphologie der Erdoberfläche’ (1894), although
largely concerned with the historical development of the subject, presents
all forms as the result of process. De Lapparent’s ‘Leçons de
géographie physique’ (1886) treats land forms generically; and a
second edition of the book is called for soon after the first. ‘Earth
Sculpture,’ by James Geikie (1899), and Marr’s ‘Scientific Study of
Scenery’ (1900), carry modern ideas to British readers. There can be
little doubt that the books of the coming century will extend the habit
of explanation even further than it has yet reached.</p>

<p>This review of the advance of the century in the study of land
forms, the habitations of all the higher forms of life, might have been
concerned wholly with the concrete results of exploration, as was implied
in an earlier paragraph. Travels in the Far East of the Old
World, or in the Far West of the New, have yielded fact enough to fill
volumes. But such a view of the century has been here replaced by
another; not because the first is unimportant, for it is absolutely essential,
but because the second includes the first and goes beyond it. Not
the facts alone, but the principles that the facts exemplify, demand our
attention. These principles, founded upon a multitude of observations,
are the greater contribution of the closing to the opening century in
the study of the Forms of the Land.</p>

<h2 title="The New York Botanical Garden" id="new">THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By</span> DANIEL TREMBLY MACDOUGAL,<br />

<span class="small">DIRECTOR OF THE LABORATORIES.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">A botanical</span> garden is a museum of plants in the broadest sense
of the term, and its chief purpose is to represent, by means of
living specimens so far as possible, the principal types of the vegetation
of the globe. It is obviously impossible to cultivate on any small area
more than a few thousand of the quarter of a million of species in
existence, and hence the plantations are supplemented by preserved
specimens to illustrate the forms, which, by reasons of limitation of
space, climate and soil, cannot be grown in the locality. In addition
the species which formed the vegetation of the previous geological
periods are represented by fossil specimens completing the history of
the plant world so far as it is known, and yielding suggestions as to
the descent of the present types.</p>

<p>Two general educational purposes are served by an institution of
this character. Its collections are arranged to present information
on the form, relationship, mode of life, habit and general biological
character of the principal types of vegetation, in such manner as to
be capable of comprehension by persons unacquainted with the technical
aspects of the subject. Further interpretation of such facts
may be made by means of books, journals, and lectures devoted entirely
to this phase of the subject.</p>

<p>The material accumulated for the exploitation of popular knowledge
of plants also affords an excellent basis for the induction of
students into the more strictly scientific aspects of botany, and when
supplemented by laboratories furnished with apparatus, microscopes,
and other instruments of precision, the activities of these students may
be carried beyond the frontiers of the subject in the investigation and
discovery of new facts and phenomena. This extension of the boundaries
of knowledge concerning the plant world may be carried on
to advantage, only when a library is at hand, which contains all
of the more important literature bearing upon the subject. The
descriptions of the results of such researches should be made in publications
devoted exclusively to this purpose, in accordance with the practice
of all the more important botanical institutions in the world.</p>

<p>The general scope of the New York Botanical Garden has already
been described by the writer in a previous number of this magazine
(January, 1897). The greater part of its actual construction and organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
has taken place in the last three years, and it has now
entered upon the discharge of its chief functions.</p>

<div id="ip_172" class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
  <img src="images/illo_062.jpg" width="800" height="676" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Map of the Garden.</span></div></div>

<p>The Garden comprises two hundred and fifty acres of land in Bronx
Park, in the City of New York, which was set aside for that purpose
by the Department of Public Parks in 1895. A fireproof museum
building of stone, brick and terra cotta, 308 by 110 feet, has been
erected for the Garden by the city in the western part of the grounds,
near the Bedford Park Station of the New York Central Railroad.
The building has a basement floor and three stories, with a total
floor space of nearly two acres, and a window area equal to half that
of the floor area. The basement contains a lecture theater capable of
seating seven hundred people, two large exhibition halls, preparation
rooms, constant temperature laboratory, offices and storerooms. The
first floor is devoted to a collection of economic plants, and the temporary
installation of useful products in the way of foods, drugs, timbers,
woods, fibers, gums, waxes, resins, oils, sugars, starches, poisons,
utensils, etc., gives hints as to the great diversity of uses that may
be made of vegetable products, together with an illustration of their
method of preparation and their derivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
The second floor is given over to an exhibit of types of all of the
more important families and tribes of plants, from the simplest and
most minute, to the highest and most complex. Specimens, models,
fruits, seeds, drawings and photographs are used to bring the principal
facts clearly before the observer. A set of swinging frames running
parallel to the cases containing the types of the flora of the world, are
used to display specimens of the plants found within a hundred miles
of New York City. A number of special microscopes have been constructed
for the purpose of forming a perfect exhibit, which will enable
the visitor to see some of the more salient features in the minute
structure of some of the plants in the cases.</p>

<div id="ip_173" class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">
  <img src="images/illo_063.jpg" width="428" height="244" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Museum.</span></div></div>

<p>The third floor contains the library, herbarium and laboratories.
The library occupies a stack room extending to the rear of the middle
of the building, two small storerooms and a large circular reading-room,
under the illuminated dome. Here are assembled the botanical
books of Columbia University, as well as those accumulated by the
Garden, now numbering more than eight thousand volumes, with no
reckoning of unbound separates and pamphlets. The collection of
botanical periodicals is nearly complete, and the library is especially
rich in literature concerning the mosses, ferns, and the flora of North
and South America.</p>

<p>The main herbarium occupies a room in the east wing, eighty-five
by forty-seven feet, and connected with it are storerooms and offices
adequate to its administration. Windows on all sides of the main
room and skylights give ample illumination. The number of mounted
specimens on the shelves is not less than three quarters of a million,
including the herbarium of Columbia University, which is deposited
here in accordance with the agreement between the two institutions.
The collection is especially rich in fungi, embracing the collections of
Ellis and other eminent mycologists. A large amount of material of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
great historic value in connection with the work of Dr. John Torrey
and the earlier botanical development of America is included. Accessions
are being made to the herbarium at the rate of fifty to a hundred
thousand specimens annually.</p>

<div id="ip_174" class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;">
  <img src="images/illo_064.jpg" width="255" height="408" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">In the Forest.</span></div></div>

<p>The laboratories consist of a series of rooms facing northward and
westward, with special facilities for taxonomic, embryological and
morphological investigations. Physiological and photographic darkrooms,
the experiment room for living plants and chemical laboratories
offer especially ample opportunities for the record and development
of practically all phases of plant physiology. The laboratories, library
and herbarium are open to the graduate students from Columbia
University, in addition to those from other institutions of learning who
may register directly at the Garden. The latter, in return, have the
privileges of students at Columbia University.</p>

<p>A weekly convention of all of the workers in botany in New York
City is held in the museum, at which the results of recent researches
are given or an address is made by an invited speaker from out of
the city.</p>

<p>The area of the Garden presents a very irregular topography, comprising,
as it does, a half mile of the valley of the Bronx River, low
marshes and swamps, artificial lakes, open glades, with heavy peaty
soil, upland plains with gravelly sandy soil, granite ridges, and about
seventy acres of natural forest. About forty acres of this forest consist
of a dense grove of hemlocks, which has never been seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
disturbed by the hand of man. It is truly remarkable that the City of
New York should include within its boundaries a primitive forest of
this size, and this invaluable feature is to be preserved forever by a special
contract between the Garden and the Department of Public Parks.
Since a hemlock forest is a climactic formation, and is not replaced by
any other growth unless cut down, it may be expected to endure through
the present geological epoch, barring the accidents of flood, storm and
fire. The great diversity of conditions offered by the natural features
of the Garden gives it a very rich population of indigenous plants.
A census of the ferns and seed-plants at the time the tract was converted
to its present purpose showed nearly a thousand species.</p>

<div id="ip_175" class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
  <img src="images/illo_065.jpg" width="550" height="426" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The North Meadows.</span></div></div>

<p>The entire area has been handled most sympathetically by those in
charge of the architectural features of the Garden. The buildings
were erected in the more open western part of the grounds, which
offered the least valuable landscape features, and the surface around
them has been improved by plantings. The natural beauties of the tract
have been most zealously guarded from disturbances of all kinds. The
attractive panoramas of wild woodland and stream offered to the artist
and lover of nature have been left absolutely untouched, but made
more valuable by increased ease and safety of access.</p>

<p>A number of special biological groups of plants have been established
in suitable places in various parts of the Garden. The trees are in the
arboretum east of the Bronx on the side and summit of a long ridge; unassorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
and reserve material of all kinds is kept in the nurseries on
the eastern slope of the same ridge; the salicetum is established on
the border of the marsh in the northern end of the Garden, giving
the willows and poplars the conditions under which they grow best.
The fruticetum occupies an adjoining upland plain underlaid with
gravel to a depth of twenty feet, affording space for the cultivation of
a large number of shrubs, while the conifers are located on slopes
to the westward of the hemlock forest. The viticetum is along the
western edge of the forest, and the trellises of logs and timbers, extending
for a length of six hundred feet, give suitable support to the
vines. The herbaceous plantation occupies an open glade to the westward
of the forest, and lies between two granite ridges. It is traversed
through the middle by a small stream widened at places into lagoons for
aquatic forms. About twenty-two hundred species are now in cultivation
in this plantation. The wide border plantations which are
established along the boundaries also offer opportunities for the growth
of a great variety of trees, herbs and shrubs.</p>

<div id="ip_176" class="figcenter" style="width: 571px;">
  <img src="images/illo_066.jpg" width="571" height="414" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Waterfall.</span></div></div>

<p>The horticultural houses, also erected by the City for the Garden, are
located in the western part of the grounds at some distance to the south
of, and facing, the museum. A palm-house, with a total height of dome
of ninety feet, is the central feature, from which lower ranges extend on
either side, making a total length of front of five hundred and twelve
feet. The horticultural houses, as well as the museum, are heated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
steam furnished by a power house beside the railroad on the extreme
edge of the Garden.</p>

<p>The collections of living plants in the plantations are arranged in
the same system as the synoptic collection in the museum. Every
plantation contains species of similar habit, and the horticultural houses
are used for the cultivation of forms which may not endure the outdoor
climate of this locality. Not only are the plants from warmer zones
grown under glass, but when it is desired to develop native species
out of their season, they may be forced and brought to full development
and bloom in the winter.</p>

<div id="ip_177" class="figcenter" style="width: 570px;">
  <img src="images/illo_067.jpg" width="570" height="411" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">In the Herbaceous Plantation.</span></div></div>

<p>The construction of driveways and paths is being prosecuted by the
Park Department with all available funds at their commands.</p>

<p>Public appreciation of the natural beauties of the Garden, and of
the phases of botany illustrated by its collections has been most gratifying,
as shown by the great and constantly increasing number of visitors.
The series of popular lectures given in the museum on Saturday afternoons
have been well attended. The Journal of the Garden, which
serves as a means of communication with its members, brings to the
notice of its readers interesting facts in botany, horticulture and forestry,
and records a constantly swelling list of gifts of books, specimens
and plants.</p>

<p>The library, herbarium and laboratories have been open for only a
few months, yet twenty-two students have taken advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
facilities thus afforded during the collegiate year now closing. Investigations
of importance have been carried forward by these students, by
members of the staff, and by the members of the staff of Columbia
University. The results of some of these investigations have been published
in the Bulletin of the Garden, which also contains the official
reports of the organization. Papers written by members of the staff
or students are reprinted from the periodicals in which they appear as
contributions, while a fourth series of Memoirs has been found necessary
for the presentation of papers of great length.</p>

<p>Not the least important of the investigating functions of a garden
consists in its participation in the exploration of remote or unknown
parts of the world in an effort to obtain a better knowledge of the plant
population of the earth. During the brief period of its activity the
Garden has already carried out work of this character in the Rocky
Mountains and in Porto Rico.</p>

<div id="ip_178" class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
  <img src="images/illo_068.jpg" width="433" height="250" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Horticultural Houses.</span></div></div>

<p>The ordinary work of the Garden is maintained by the income from
its endowment fund, by the annual dues of its members (now numbering
over eight hundred) and by an annual appropriation by the City. Its
board of managers is authorized to hold and administer trust funds, and
it is hoped by the aid of gifts or bequests for special or general
purposes to expand its usefulness in directing investigation. Already
it has been favored by a bequest of a considerable sum of money by
the late ex-Chief Justice Charles P. Daly, which may be devoted to any
purpose determined by the board of managers.</p>

<h2 title="Gas and Gas Meters" id="gas">GAS AND GAS METERS.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By</span> HUBERT S. WYNKOOP, M. E.</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">What</span> is the matter with our illuminating gas? Why is its quality
so poor? Why is it that our bills are creeping up, in spite
of the fact that the rate per thousand cubic feet is going down? These
are questions that periodically recur to the mind of every householder.</p>

<p>Just why the public has not been educated into a correct understanding
of the gas situation is hard to say, unless it be that an inbred
prejudice against believing the word of any corporation has led to an
utter repudiation of such explanatory statements as may emanate from
time to time from the gas office. And it must be admitted that many
of the explanations are misleading, either through the intention of the
superior officials or by reason of the ignorance of their subordinates.</p>

<p>Hardly has the chill of shortening days driven us indoors in the
early twilight before complaints of poor gas become epidemic. Now,
what <i>is</i> ‘poor’ gas? Is the gas deficient in light-giving constituents,
or is it merely burned in such a manner as not to afford a satisfactory
illumination?</p>

<p>The charter of Greater New York requires that the illuminating
gas supplied throughout the city shall be of at least twenty candle
power, or illuminating quality, or richness&mdash;that is to say, if we burn
this gas in a standard burner at the standard pressure (or at as near
this pressure as may be), so that the rate of consumption is five cubic
feet an hour, the flame thus produced shall be equivalent to twenty
standard sperm candles, each burning at the rate of one hundred and
twenty grains of sperm per hour, and all bunched&mdash;if such a thing
were possible. There can be hardly any doubt but that all the gas sent
out from modern gas works fulfills the above requirement. Indeed, my
own tests give results ranging from twenty-two to twenty-eight candles,
with an average of about twenty-four. Manifestly, the gas <i>sent out</i> is
not ‘poor.’</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the fact that the gas as manufactured is of the required
candle power is no indication that the product as delivered
to the consumer will give a similarly satisfactory test. Distribution
of gas is attended with many perplexities, not the least of which is condensation.
The illuminating hydrocarbons, or light-giving constituents
held in suspension in the gas, are not so firmly fixed therein as
to be unaffected by the size of the pipe, the character of the internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
pipe surface, and barometric and thermometric variations. The transmission
of gas causes, therefore, a loss of candle power ranging from a
small fraction to several candles, although it is possible to conceive of
conditions so extraordinarily favorable that the illuminating quality
of the gas might be actually improved by distribution.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood from this explanation that tests made
at the gas works, or even at points arbitrarily selected at a certain
distance from these works, are hardly calculated to satisfy the consumer.
For this reason I have preferred, in conducting these tests,
to sacrifice to some degree the accuracy that obtains in laboratory
experiments, in order to test gas samples <i>taken from the main directly
in front of the complainant’s own premises</i>. I argue that the consumer
cares little or nothing as to whether the gas as manufactured complies
with the law, or whether tests made at a point perhaps a mile away
from the works show the required candle power; but that he does
want to know what is the quality of the gas passing in at his service
pipe. The method of collecting and transporting to a laboratory the
gas samples enables one to say with positiveness that the gas at the
point of complaint has an illuminating power of at least so many
candles, and that it may be even one candle better than the tests
indicate. The figures thus obtained range from twenty and a half to
twenty-five. So, then, the gas <i>delivered to the consumer</i> is not ‘poor.’</p>

<p>Hygienic reasons demand that the impurities in the gas shall not
exceed a definite percentage. Whatever effect these impurities may
have upon the candle power has been covered by the tests above explained,
so that any further consideration of these impurities may be
omitted here.</p>

<p>It is always a difficult matter to convince an indignant householder
that the quality of the gas supplied to him is satisfactory. He knows
perfectly well that he is not getting the desired result, and no explanation,
however elaborate, as to candle power will placate him, unless it
be supplemented by a further statement detailing the cause of the
trouble. When you are trying to draw water in the bathroom while the
cook is filling the washtubs in the basement, do you say the water
is ‘poor’? Why, then, should you characterize the gas as ‘poor,’
when people nearer to the gas works than you are happen to be drawing
heavily upon the common gas main? Imagine, if you please, a
long gas main, with consumers tapping in at points throughout its entire
length, and with a gas holder forcing the gas in at one end. Since
there is a loss of pressure, caused by the transmission, it follows that
the pressure will be higher at the gas holder than anywhere else along
the line, the <i>difference</i> in pressure depending, roughly, upon the size and
length of the pipe and upon the amount of gas flowing. Now, for any
one customer the size and length of pipe will remain constant, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
flow of gas along the line will vary from hour to hour, consequently the
pressure at his house may be expected to vary from hour to hour.</p>

<p>The unit of measurement of gas pressure is that pressure which
will cause a difference of water level of one tenth of an inch in the
two legs of a V-shaped tube when one end is connected with the gas
main and the other end is left open to the outer air. Ten tenths, or
one inch, is the standard, or normal pressure.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Exhibit 1.</span></div></div>

<p>Any appliance&mdash;even a gas-burner&mdash;operates to best advantage
under certain well-defined conditions. Depart from these conditions,
and the efficiency of the device is impaired to an extent depending
largely upon the nature of the appliance under consideration. For
example, burn an incandescent lamp at fifty per cent. above normal
voltage and it breaks down; burn a gas jet at two hundred per cent.
above normal pressure, and it still operates&mdash;how satisfactorily ‘deponent
sayeth not.’ Now, the gas-burner is supposed to operate to best
advantage at ten tenths of an inch. At this pressure the flame is neither
so wavering as to be affected by every chance draught, nor so rigid as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
permit the gas to blow through without being properly consumed. Below
the normal the flame decreases; above, the light is increased somewhat,
but not by any means in proportion to the increase in the gas flow.
Thus we see that the satisfactory employment of gas as an illuminant
depends upon the maintenance of a pressure high enough to deliver
the required amount of gas, but not so high as to cause wasteful
consumption.</p>

<div id="ip_182" class="figcenter" style="width: 543px;">
  <img src="images/illo_072.jpg" width="543" height="540" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Exhibit 2.</span></div></div>

<p>Turning back now to the gas main, let us consider the pressures
actually existing. <a href="#ip_181">Exhibit 1</a> is a photograph of a twenty-four-hour
record of pressure at a point not far from the works. The radial
lines represent time, and there is a line for each quarter of an hour.
The circles represent pressure, there being one circle for each tenth of
an inch. Starting at <i>E</i>, the point at which the record begins, and
following the irregular line clockwise, one may readily determine the
fluctuations of pressure and the time of their occurrence. Interpreting
the diagram, we find that the pressure was slightly above
the normal until 4.30 <span class="smcap smaller">P.&nbsp;M.</span> (<i>A</i>), when the works began to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
the pressure little by little, in order to compensate for the increased
loss due to increased flow through the mains. At 6.15 <span class="smcap smaller">P.&nbsp;M.</span> (<i>B</i>), the
works ceased increasing the pressure. While this increase lasted&mdash;from
6.15 <span class="smcap smaller">P.&nbsp;M.</span> (<i>B</i>) to 10.15 <span class="smcap smaller">P.&nbsp;M.</span> (<i>C</i>)&mdash;our friend near the works
suffered under twenty-one tenths pressure, the gas blowing merrily
through the tips and the meter conscientiously registering gas wasted
as well as gas utilized. From 10.15 <span class="smcap smaller">P.&nbsp;M.</span> (<i>C</i>) the pressure falls by steps
during the ensuing two hours, finally reaching eleven tenths just after
midnight (<i>D</i>), which latter pressure is quite steadily maintained until
the following forenoon. The service from bedtime to dinner time
should have proved quite satisfactory. One would naturally expect
to find this consumer complaining of high bills, however.</p>

<div id="ip_183" class="figcenter" style="width: 538px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Exhibit 3.</span></div></div>

<p>Visiting the fellow at the distant end of the line, we find conditions
widely at variance from those already considered.<a href="#ip_182"> Exhibit 2</a> tells a new
story. The recording gauge was placed in service at 4 <span class="smcap smaller">P.&nbsp;M.</span> (<i>E</i>), and
shortly afterward (<i>A</i>), the pressure began to fall. The jets grew
dimmer and dimmer, while the Welsbach mantles became petticoats of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
red, with hems of white at the bottom. No wonder this man complains
of ‘poor’ gas, while some learned friend, dropping in for an evening
cigar, explains that there is ‘air in the pipes.’ The one consolatory
reflection is that, at all events, the poor fellow had a good light to undress
by (<i>B</i> to <i>C</i>).</p>

<div id="ip_184" class="figcenter" style="width: 544px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Exhibit 4.</span></div></div>

<p><a href="#ip_183">Exhibits 3</a> and <a href="#ip_184">4</a> come from my own residence. Together they form
a ‘before-taking’ and ‘after-taking’ advertisement&mdash;not of medicine,
but of a gas governor. The fact that I am located at a considerable
distance&mdash;several miles&mdash;from the works, and am supplied through a
main laid a number of years ago, when the territory was sparsely
settled, enables me to present <a href="#ip_183">Exhibit 3</a>. Comment on this record is
unnecessary. After securing this diagram I installed a governor and
set it at eleven tenths. <a href="#ip_184">Exhibit 4</a> shows what happened. I am now
doing for myself, and at my own expense, that which the gas company
fails to do for me. This governor, therefore, renders me almost entirely
independent of the gas company; and, in order to demonstrate more
clearly to what degree this independence extends, the gauge has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
allowed to run for forty-eight hours without changing the card, thus
super-imposing the record of the second day upon that of the first.
Note how closely the readings for the two days agree. The governor
is a protection against excess of pressure only; if the street
pressure falls below eleven tenths&mdash;the point at which my governor
is set&mdash;automatic regulation ceases, and my gas simply becomes
subject to practically the same variations as exist on the main. Happily,
the latter condition is infrequently realized in our neighborhood.
No argument is needed to prove how successfully a governing device
of this nature can cope with the trouble indicated by <a href="#ip_181">Exhibit 1</a>, or
how utterly inadequate it is to afford relief from the evil depicted in
<a href="#ip_182">Exhibit 2</a>. Increased pressure is the only remedy for the latter.</p>

<p>The gas company does not recommend the use of these house-to-house
governors&mdash;presumably because such a recommendation would
be in effect an admission that the service as now maintained by the
company is not satisfactory. Indeed, the less enlightened officials&mdash;and
it is these, unfortunately, with whom the consumer has generally
to deal&mdash;positively and unreasoningly condemn all such regulating
devices. In spite of this, there exist to-day several gas-reduction companies,
whose sole occupation consists in exploiting various gas-pressure-regulating
appliances, which are rented to consumers for a certain percentage
of the monthly saving in the gas bills which their use effects.</p>

<p>It would appear to be a self-evident proposition that when one pays
for gas delivered at his meter he is entitled to receive that gas under
such a pressure as will afford the most satisfactory service. This
pressure is found to be one inch. Making due allowance for reasonable
fluctuations of a few tenths above the normal, any further departure
from the standard may be taken as a sure indication of a disinclination
on the part of the company to meet the expense of new pipes and
regulating apparatus. The time is not far distant when the public will
demand, not cheaper gas nor better gas, but a more satisfactory service.
But before condemning the gas company one must look to his house
piping. The company’s responsibility ends just inside the meter, and
from that point the consumer must provide satisfactory appliances,
giving the same attention to the gas pipes as he gives to the plumbing.
This is seldom done and the company is frequently blamed for the
neglect of the householder.</p>

<p>The gas engineer, steering between the Scylla of ‘poor’ gas and
the Charybdis of excessive pressures, finds himself still ‘dangerous
in the rapids’ of financial expenditure. At present he is doing the
best he can with the money doled out to him by the management.</p>

<p>It will be observed that up to the present point the gas meter
itself has played no part in the discussion. The meter, although greatly
maligned, is in reality an eminently satisfactory piece of mechanism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Concerning this apparatus many erroneous notions prevail. One
of these is that a householder may burn thousands of feet of gas
without cost to himself, provided he keeps the company in blissful
ignorance of the employment of gas for heating purposes upon his
premises. The demonstration of the falsity of this idea lies within the
reach of any one who will take the trouble to read his own meter on
those days on which the company’s indexer pays his monthly visits.</p>

employed on the three, five and ten light meters, the sizes commonly
found in our dwellings. The smaller dial, placed centrally above the
other, is known as the ‘proving dial,’ and, being used merely for
testing purposes, is not considered in reading the gas consumption.
Although the index dials vary in nomenclature as well as in number,
it is generally safe to consider that if the name is placed <i>above</i> the
dial a complete revolution of the pointer is required to register the
amount of gas indicated by the name; whereas if the name is placed
<i>below</i> the dial each numbered division of the dial represents the amount
corresponding to the name. If doubt still exists as to the value of each
division of the lowest or right-hand dial, remember that no meter index
is designed to read less than one hundred cubic feet for each division
of the circle.</p>

<p>After one has indexed his own meter for a month or two he is in
a position to begin checking the bills presented. The ‘present state of
meter’ and the ‘previous state of meter’ are always specified, and the
mere subtraction of the former from the latter gives the consumption.
This is not invariably the case, however. After a meter has registered
its maximum reading&mdash;100,000 in the smaller sizes&mdash;it passes over the
zero point and begins to build up a new record. This happens at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
intervals as long as the apparatus is kept in service. Before me lies
a bill giving the ‘present state’ as 1,700 and the ‘previous state’ as
96,300. Since the meter was continuously employed, it must have
registered up to 100,000, so that it registered 3,700 cubic feet on the
old score before recording 1,700 cubic feet on the new. Consequently,
adding 1,700 to the difference between ‘previous state’ and the highest
possible reading gives 5,400 cubic feet&mdash;the amount consumed during
the month. By reading one’s own meter the detection of any error on
the part of the indexer or of the clerical force at the gas office becomes
possible. Errors of this nature are of rare occurrence, as those who have
adopted this plan of checking gas bills will testify. The responsibility
for excessive bills is thus taken from the gas employees and thrown entirely
upon the gas-registering mechanism itself. Those people, then,
who chuckle furtively over the fact that the gas company has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
‘caught on’ to the surreptitious use of gas ranges are either the fortunate
possessors of ‘slow’ meters or are deluding themselves as to the amount
of gas which they actually consume.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.&mdash;Interior of Common Gas Meter.</span></div></div>

<p><a href="#ip_188">Fig. 4</a> is a photograph of the common dry meter, with the front,
back, top and left side removed. It is called a ‘dry’ meter to distinguish
it from those meters, having little vogue in this country,
which employ a liquid in place of a valve motion. The apparatus
shown consists of a case divided into three compartments by a horizontal
partition one fourth of the way down from the top, and by a
vertical partition centrally placed and extending upward from the
bottom of the casing to the horizontal partition. The upper compartment
contains the registering mechanism and a small valve chamber,
the latter corresponding to the steam chest of an engine. In each
of the lower compartments is a metal disk attached to the central
partition by well-oiled flexible leathers, each disk, leather and the
partition forming a bellows. As in a locomotive, the meter really
consists of two separate mechanisms, set to operate out of phase and
avoid dead centers.</p>

<div class="p1 center-container"><div class="poem">
<div id="ip_188b" class="figleft" style="width: 187px;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></div></div>
</div></div>

<p>Considering one mechanism only, recourse may be had to a diagrammatic
representation of the action (<a href="#ip_188b">Fig. 5</a>). Gas entering the
inlet passes into the valve chamber. Here an ordinary D-slide-valve
closes two of the openings, leaving a third through which the gas may
flow into the bellows or inner compartment. The bellows expands,
gradually filling the outer compartment, and forcing the gas out under
the valve into the outlet pipe, as indicated by the arrows. When
the bellows is fully distended the valve shifts into the position shown
in <a href="#ip_188c">Fig. 6</a>, admitting the inflowing gas to the outer compartment and
collapsing the bellows, whose contents are forced into the outlet pipe
by the paths traced by the arrows.</p>

<p>Thus, it will be observed, the meter is a volume measurer pure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
simple, measuring cubic feet with as much deliberation as is required
to deal water out of a cask by means of a pint dipper. Its percentage
of error is the same at all pressures and under all loads within its
capacity, and it measures cubic feet of gas regardless of whether that
gas be expanded or compressed.</p>

<p>And so we are obliged to realize, as another fallacy is exposed, that
the meter does not spin around most energetically under the higher
pressures, cheerfully and accommodatingly serving its masters by adding
a mythical cubic foot or two to the count at each revolution.</p>

<p>It remains, then, to consider the error of the meter. The custom
is, in New York at least, not to set a meter that registers fast&mdash;that
registers a greater volume of gas than actually passes through it. If
it is found to be slow, however, and not more than three per cent.,
it is allowed to go out. As a result, the meter, when first placed,
always favors the consumer, sometimes to the extent of recording only
ninety-seven feet of gas for each one hundred feet actually passed.
Owing to the aging of the mechanism and the drying out of the
leathers, there exists a tendency to increase the registry for each cubic
foot passed. In this way a slow meter may become a fast meter after
a period of active service. From the meager data at my disposal, it
would appear that every meter should be called in for a thorough overhauling
and readjustment at periodic intervals of from three to five
years.</p>

<p>Assuming that there are several million gas meters in Greater New
York alone, it is but natural to expect that out of this vast number,
in spite of any reasonable care that may have been exercised in their
adjustment originally, many will be found subsequently to be defective&mdash;some
because of mechanical injury, some through sheer old age.
Unfortunately, it is not possible as yet to obtain a convincingly large
array of figures; but in the Borough of Brooklyn, where there are in
service nearly a quarter of a million meters, and where complaints
against them have been studiously encouraged by the authorities, one
hundred and eighty-seven meters have been carefully tested. Here are
the results:</p>

When one remembers that these one hundred and eighty-seven
meters are presumably the worst of their kind, having been put in
evidence by a naturally suspicious public, it is but fair to assume that
the figures overrate rather than underestimate the errors of the average
gas meter. Quoting from <i>The Progressive Age</i>, a journal devoted
largely to the interests of the gas industry: “The meters made to-day
will remain a long while in service before they begin to register incorrectly,
and when we consider the dampness, extremes of temperature
and hard usage they receive as they are transferred from cellar to attic,
from among the dust, cobwebs and litter of a basement closet to the
corner shelf of some coal cellar, to be the playground of rats, spiders
and cockroaches, to be drenched in summer by sweating or leaky water
pipes and wear a venerable beard of icicles in winter&mdash;to be, in fact,
the worst-used machine about a gas plant&mdash;we can not fail but express
surprise that it registers at all correctly.”</p>

<h2 title="The Sun’s Destination" id="sun">THE SUN’S DESTINATION.<br />

<span class="subhead small notbold"><span class="smcap">By Professor</span> HAROLD JACOBY,<br />

<span class="small">COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.</span></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Three</span> generations of men have come and gone since the Marquis
de Laplace stood before the Academy of France and gave his
demonstration of the permanent stability of our solar system. There
was one significant fault in Newton’s superbly simple conception of an
eternal law governing the world in which we live. The labors of
mathematicians following him had shown that the planets must trace
out paths in space whose form could be determined in advance with
unerring certainty by the aid of Newton’s law of gravitation. But
they proved just as conclusively that these planetary orbits, as they
are called, could not maintain indefinitely the same shapes or positions.
Slow indeed might be the changes they were destined to undergo;
slow, but sure, with that sureness belonging to celestial science alone.
And so men asked: Has this magnificent solar system been built
upon a scale so grand, been put in operation subject to a law sublime
in its very simplicity, only to change and change until at length it shall
lose every semblance of its former self, and end perhaps in chaos or
extinction?</p>

<p>Laplace was able to answer confidently: No. Nor was his answer
couched in the enthusiastic language of unbalanced theorists who
work by the aid of imagination alone. Based upon the irrefragable
logic of correct mathematical reasoning, and clad in the sober garb
of mathematical formulæ, his results carried conviction to men of
science the world over. So was it demonstrated that changes in our
solar system are surely at work, and shall continue for nearly countless
ages; yet just as surely will they be reversed at last, and the system will
tend to return again to its original form and condition. The objection
that the Newtonian law meant ultimate dissolution of the world was
thus destroyed by Laplace. From that day forward, the law of gravitation
has been accepted as holding sway over all phenomena visible
within our planetary world.</p>

<p>The intricacies of our own solar system being thus illumined, the
restless activity of the human intellect was stimulated to search beyond
for new problems and new mysteries. Even more fascinating than
the movements of our sun and planets are all those questions that relate
to the clustered stellar congeries hanging suspended within the deep
blue vault of night. Does the same law of gravitation cast its magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
spell over that hazy cloud of Pleiads, binding them, like ourselves,
with bonds indissoluble? Who shall answer, yes or no? We can only
say that astronomers have as yet but stepped upon the threshold of
the universe, and fixed the telescope’s great eye upon that which is
within.</p>

<p>Let us then begin by reminding the reader what is meant by that
Newtonian law of gravitation. It appears all things possess the remarkable
property of attracting or pulling each other. Newton declared
that all substances, solid, liquid or even gaseous, from the
massive cliff of rock down to the invisible air&mdash;all matter can no more
help pulling than it can help existing. His law further formulates
certain conditions governing the manner in which this gravitational
attraction is exerted; but these are mere matters of detail; interest
centers about the mysterious fact of attraction itself. How can one
thing pull another with no connecting link through which the pull
can act? Just here we touch the point that has never yet been explained.
Nature withholds from science her ultimate secrets. They
that have pondered longest, that have descended farthest of all men
into the clear well of knowledge, have done so but to sound the depths
beyond, never touching bottom.</p>

<p>This inability of ours to give a good physical explanation of gravitation
has led numerous paradoxers to doubt or even deny that there
is any such thing. But fortunately we have a simple laboratory experiment
that helps us. Unexplained it may ever remain, but that
there can be attraction between physical objects connected by no visible
link is proved by the behavior of an ordinary magnet. Place a small
piece of steel or iron near a magnetized bar, and it will at once be so
strongly attracted that it will actually fly to the magnet. Any one
who has seen this simple experiment can never again deny the possibility
at least of the law of attraction as stated by Newton. Its
possibility once admitted, the fact that it can predict the motions of
all the planets, even shown to the minutest details, transforms the possibility
of its birth into a certainty as strong as any human certainty can
ever be.</p>

<p>But this demonstration of Newton’s law is limited strictly to the
solar system itself. We may indeed reason by analogy, and take for
granted that a law which holds within our immediate neighborhood is
extremely likely to be true also of the entire visible universe. But
men of science are loath to reason thus; and hence the fascination of
researches in cosmic astronomy. Analogy points out the path. The
astronomer is not slow to follow; but he seeks ever to establish upon
incontrovertible evidence those truths which at first only his daring
imagination had led him to half suspect. If we are to extend the
law of gravitation to the utmost, we must be careful to consider the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
law itself in its most complete form. A heavenly body like the sun
is often said to govern the motions of its family of planets; but such
a statement is not strictly accurate. The governing body is no despot;
’tis an abject slave of law and order, as much as the tiniest of attendant
planets. The action of gravitation is mutual, and no cosmic body can
attract another without being itself in turn subject to that other’s
gravitational action. If there were in our solar system but two bodies,
sun and planet, we should find each one pursuing a path in space under
the influence of the other’s attraction. These two paths or orbits
would be oval, and if the sun and planet were equally massive, the
orbits would be exactly alike, both in shape and size. But if the sun
were far larger than the planet, the orbits would still be similar in
form, but the one traversed by the larger body would be small. For
it is not reasonable to expect a little planet to keep the big sun moving
with a velocity as great as that derived by itself from the attraction
of the larger orb. Whenever the preponderance of the larger body is
extremely great, its orbit will be correspondingly insignificant in size.
This is in fact the case with our own sun. So massive is it in comparison
with the planets, that the orbit is too small to reveal its actual
existence without the aid of our most refined instruments. The path
traced out by the sun’s center would not fill a space as large as the
sun’s own bulk. Nevertheless, true orbital motion is there.</p>

<p>So we may conclude that as a necessary consequence of the law of
gravitation every object within the solar system is in motion. To
say that planets revolve about the sun is to neglect as unimportant the
small orbit of the sun itself. This may be sufficiently accurate for
ordinary purposes; but it is unquestionably necessary to neglect no
factor, however small, if we propose to extend our reasoning to a consideration
of the stellar universe. For we shall then have to deal with
systems in which the planets are of a size comparable with the sun;
and in such systems all the orbits will also be of comparatively equal
importance.</p>

<p>Mathematical analysis has derived another fact from discussion
of the law of gravitation which perhaps transcends in simple grandeur
everything we have as yet mentioned. It matters not how great may
be the number of massive orbs threading their countless interlacing
curved paths in space, there yet must be in every cosmic system one
single point immovable. This point is called the Center of Gravity.
If it should so happen that in the beginning of things, some particle
of matter were situated at this center, then would that atom ever
remain unmoved and imperturbable throughout all the successive
vicissitudes of cosmic evolution. It is doubtful whether the mind of
man can form a conception of anything grander than such an immovable
atom within the mysterious intricacies of cosmic motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
But in general, we can not suppose that the centers of gravity in
the various stellar systems are really occupied by actual physical bodies.
The center may be a mere mathematical point in space, situated among
the several bodies composing the system, but nevertheless endowed
with the same remarkable property of relative immobility.</p>

<p>Having thus defined the center of gravity in its relation to the
constituent parts of any cosmic system, we can pass easily to its characteristic
properties in connection with the inter-relation of stellar
systems with one another. It can be proved mathematically that our
solar system will pull upon distant stars just as though the sun and
all the planets were concentrated into one vast sphere having its center
in the center of gravity of the whole. It is this property of the center
of gravity which makes it preëminently important in cosmic researches.
For, while we know that center to be at rest relatively to all the planets
in the system, it may, nevertheless, in its quality as a sort of concentrated
essence of them all, be moving swiftly through space under
the pull of distant stars. In that case, the attendant bodies will go
with it&mdash;but they will pursue their evolutions within the system, all
unconscious that the center of gravity is carrying them on a far wider
circuit.</p>

<p>What is the nature of that circuit? This question has been for
many years the subject of earnest study by the clearest minds among
astronomers. The greatest difficulty in the way is the comparatively
brief period during which men have been able to make astronomical
observations of precision. Space and time are two conceptions that
transcend the powers of definition possessed by any man. But we can
at least form a notion of how vast is the extent of time, if we remember
that the period covered by man’s written records is registered
but as a single moment upon the great revolving dial of heaven’s dome.
One hundred and fifty years have elapsed since James Bradley built the
foundations of sidereal astronomy upon his masterly series of star-observations
at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, in England. Yet
so slowly do the movements of the stars unroll themselves upon the
firmament, that even to this day no one of them has been seen by men
to trace out more than an infinitesimal fraction of its destined path
through the voids of space.</p>

<p>Travelers upon a railroad can not tell at any given moment whether
they are moving in a straight line, or whether the train is turning upon
some curve of huge size. The St. Gothard railway has several so-called
‘corkscrew’ tunnels, within which the rails make a complete turn in
a spiral, the train finally emerging from the tunnel at a point almost
vertically over the entrance. In this way the train is lifted to a higher
level. Passengers are wont to amuse themselves while in these tunnels
by watching the needle of an ordinary pocket compass. This needle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of course, always points to the north; and as the train turns upon its
curve, the needle will make a complete revolution. But the passenger
could not know without the compass that the train was not moving
in a perfectly straight line. Just so we passengers on the earth are
unaware of the kind of path we are traversing, until, like the compass,
the astronomer’s instruments shall reveal to us the truth.</p>

<p>But as we have seen, astronomical observations of precision have
not as yet extended through a period of time corresponding to the
few minutes during which the St. Gothard traveler watches the compass.
We are still in the dark, and do not know as yet whether mankind
shall last long enough upon the earth to see the compass needle
make its revolution. We are compelled to believe that the motion in
space of our sun is progressing upon a curved path; but so far as
precise observations allow us to speak, we can but say that we have
as yet moved through an infinitesimal element only of that mighty
curve. However, we know the point upon the sky towards which this
tiny element of our path is directed, and we have an approximate
knowledge of the speed at which we move.</p>

<p>More than a century ago Sir William Herschel was able to fix
roughly what we call the Apex of the sun’s way in space, or the point
among the stars towards which that way is for the moment directed.
We say for the moment, but we mean that moment of which Bradley
saw the beginning in 1750, and upon whose end no man of those now
living shall ever look. Herschel found that a comparison of old stellar
observations seemed to indicate that the stars in a certain part of the
sky were opening out, as it were, and that the constellations in the
opposite part of the heavens seemed to be drawing in, or becoming
smaller. There can be but one reasonable explanation of this. We
must be moving towards that part of the sky where the stars are
separating. Just so a man watching a regiment of soldiers approaching,
will see at first only a confused body of men. But as they come
nearer the individual soldiers will seem to separate, until at length
each one is seen distinct from all the others.</p>

<p>Herschel fixed the position of the apex at a point in the constellation
Hercules. The most recent investigations of Newcomb, published only
a few months ago, have, on the whole, verified Herschel’s conclusions.
With the intuitive power of rare genius, Herschel had been able to
sift truth out of error. The observational data at his disposal would
now be called rude, but they disclosed to the scrutiny of his acute
understanding the germ of truth that was in them. Later investigators
have increased the precision of our knowledge, until we can now
say that the present direction of the solar motion is known within
very narrow limits. A tiny circle might be drawn on the sky, to which
an astronomer might point his hand and say: Yonder little circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
contains the goal towards which the sun and planets are hastening
to-day. Even the speed of this motion has been subjected to measurement,
and found to be about ten miles per second.</p>

<p>The objective point and the rate of motion thus stated, exact science
holds her peace. Here genuine knowledge stops; and we can proceed
further only by the aid of that imagination which men of science
need to curb at every moment. But let no one think that the sun will
ever reach the so-called apex. To do so would mean cosmic motion
upon a straight line, while every consideration of celestial mechanics
points to motion upon a curve. When shall we turn sufficiently upon
that curve to detect its bending? ’Tis a problem we must leave as a
rich heritage to later generations that are to follow us. The visionary
theorist’s notion of a great central sun, controlling our own sun’s way
in space, must be dismissed as far too daring. But for such a central
sun we may substitute a central center of gravity belonging to a
great system of which our sun is but an insignificant member. Then
we reach a conception that has lost nothing in the grandeur of its
simplicity, and is yet in accord with the probabilities of sober mechanical
science. We cease to be a lonely world, and stretch out the bonds
of a common relationship to yonder stars within the firmament.</p>

<p>[Child-study has recently become a most active department of psychology.
It is the serious pursuit of men of science and the fad of women’s
clubs; a late accession to the magazines devoted to it comes from Japan.
In spite of this wide-spread zeal, few of the followers of child-study have
ever heard of one of the most valuable contributions to it. And in spite
of the eminence of the author, Darwin’s observations on the mental growth
of his child are practically unknown to most zoölogists and psychologists.</p>

<p>It is a witness to the breadth of Darwin’s interests that he should have
been among the few men who anticipated by a generation or more what is
now so wide a movement in psychology. His retention of his notes for
thirty-seven years before publishing them is thoroughly characteristic. In
this respect there is a notable difference between Darwin and the present-day
enthusiasts for child-study.]</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">M.</span> Taine’s very interesting account of the mental development
of an infant, translated in the last number of <i>Mind</i> (p. 252),
has led me to look over a diary which I kept thirty-seven years ago
with respect to one of my own infants. I had excellent opportunities
for close observation, and wrote down at once whatever was observed.
My chief object was expression, and my notes were used in my book on
this subject; but as I attended to some other points, my observations
may possibly possess some little interest in comparison with those by
M. Taine, and others which hereafter no doubt will be made. I feel
sure, from what I have seen with my own infants, that the period of
development of the several faculties will be found to differ considerably
in different infants.</p>

<p>During the first seven days various reflex actions, namely sneezing,
hickuping, yawning, stretching, and, of course, sucking and screaming,
were well performed by my infant. On the seventh day, I touched
the naked sole of his foot with a bit of paper, and he jerked it away,
curling at the same time his toes, like a much older child when tickled.
The perfection of these reflex movements shows that the extreme imperfection
of the voluntary ones is not due to the state of the muscles
or of the co-ordinating centers, but to that of the seat of the will. At
this time, though so early, it seemed clear to me that a warm, soft hand
applied to his face excited a wish to suck. This must be considered
as a reflex or an instinctive action, for it is impossible to believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
experience and association with the touch of his mother’s breast could
so soon have come into play. During the first fortnight he often started
on hearing any sudden sound, and blinked his eyes. The same fact was
observed with some of my other infants within the first fortnight.
Once, when he was 66 days old, I happened to sneeze, and he
started violently, frowned, looked frightened, and cried rather badly;
for an hour afterwards he was in a state which would be called nervous
in an older person, for every slight noise made him start. A few days
before this same date, he first started at an object suddenly seen; but
for a long time afterwards sounds made him start and wink his eyes
much more frequently than did sight; thus, when 114 days old, I shook
a pasteboard box with comfits in it near his face and he started,
whilst the same box when empty or any other object shaken as near
or much nearer to his face produced no effect. We may infer from
these several facts that the winking of the eyes, which manifestly serves
to protect them, had not been acquired through experience. Although
so sensitive to sound in a general way, he was not able even when 124
days old, easily to recognize whence a sound proceeded so as to direct
his eyes to the source.</p>

<p>With respect to vision&mdash;his eyes were fixed on a candle as early as
the 9th day, and up to the 45th day nothing else seemed thus
to fix them; but on the 49th day his attention was attracted by
a bright-colored tassel, as was shown by his eyes becoming fixed and the
movements of his arms ceasing. It was surprising how slowly he
acquired the power of following with his eyes an object if swinging at
all rapidly; for he could not do this well when seven and a half months
old. At the age of 32 days he perceived his mother’s bosom
when three or four inches from it, as was shown by the protrusion of his
lips and his eyes becoming fixed; but I much doubt whether this had
any connection with vision; he certainly had not touched the bosom.
Whether he was guided through smell or the sensation of warmth or
through association with the position in which he was held, I do not
at all know.</p>

<p>The movements of his limbs and body were for a long time vague
and purposeless, and usually performed in a jerking manner; but
there was one exception to this rule, namely, that from a very early
period, certainly long before he was 40 days old, he could move his
hands to his own mouth. When 77 days old, he took the
sucking bottle (with which he was partly fed) in his right hand,
whether he was held on the left or right arm of his nurse, and he
would not take it in his left hand until a week later, although I tried to
make him do so; so that the right hand was a week in advance of
the left. Yet this infant afterwards proved to be left-handed, the
tendency being no doubt inherited&mdash;his grandfather, mother, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
brother having been or being left-handed. When between 80 and
90 days old, he drew all sorts of objects into his mouth, and in
two or three weeks’ time could do this with some skill; but he often
first touched his nose with the object and then dragged it down into
his mouth. After grasping my finger and drawing it to his mouth,
his own hand prevented him from sucking it; but on the 114th day,
after acting in this manner, he slipped his own hand down so that
he could get the end of my finger into his mouth. This action was
repeated several times, and evidently was not a chance but a rational
one. The intentional movements of the hands and arms were thus
much in advance of those of the body and legs; though the purposeless
movements of the latter were from a very early period usually
alternate, as in the act of walking. When four months old he often
looked intently at his own hands and other objects close to him, and
in doing so the eyes were turned much inwards, so that he often
squinted frightfully. In a fortnight after this time (i. e., 132 days old),
I observed that if an object was brought as near to his face as his
own hands were, he tried to seize it, but often failed; and he did not
try to do so in regard to more distant objects. I think there can be
little doubt that the convergence of his eyes gave him the clue and
excited him to move his arms. Although this infant thus began to
use his hands at an early period, he showed no special aptitude in
this respect, for when he was two years and four months old, he
held pencils, pens, and other objects far less neatly and efficiently than
did his sister, who was then only fourteen months old, and who showed
great inherent aptitude in handling anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anger.</span>&mdash;It was difficult to decide at how early an age anger was
felt; on his eighth day he frowned and wrinkled the skin round his
eyes before a crying fit, but this may have been due to pain or distress,
and not to anger. When about ten weeks old, he was given some rather
cold milk, and he kept a slight frown on his forehead all the time
that he was sucking, so that he looked like a grown-up person made
cross from being compelled to do something which he did not like.
When nearly four months old, and perhaps much earlier, there could
be no doubt, from the manner in which the blood gushed into his
whole face and scalp, that he easily got into a violent passion. A
small cause sufficed; thus, when a little over seven months old, he
screamed with rage because a lemon slipped away and he could not
seize it with his hands. When eleven months old, if a wrong plaything
was given him, he would push it away and beat it; I presume that the
beating was an instinctive sign of anger, like the snapping of the jaws
by a young crocodile just out of the egg, and not that he imagined
he could hurt the plaything. When two years and three months
old, he became a great adept at throwing books or sticks, etc., at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
one who offended him; and so it was with some of my other sons.
On the other hand, I could never see a trace of such aptitude in my
infant daughters; and this makes me think that a tendency to throw
objects is inherited by boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fear.</span>&mdash;This feeling probably is one of the earliest which is experienced
by infants, as shown by their starting at any sudden sound
when only a few weeks old, followed by crying. Before the present
one was four and a half months old, I had been accustomed to make
close to him many strange and loud noises, which were all taken as
excellent jokes, but at this period I one day made a loud snoring noise,
which I had never done before; he instantly looked grave and then
burst out crying. Two or three days afterwards I made, through forgetfulness,
the same noise, with the same result. About the same time
(viz., on the 137th day), I approached with my back towards him
and then stood motionless; he looked very grave and much surprised,
and would soon have cried, had I not turned round; then his face
instantly relaxed into a smile. It is well known how intensely older
children suffer from vague and undefined fears, as from the dark, or in
passing an obscure corner in a large hall, etc. I may give as an instance
that I took the child in question, when two and one fourth years
old, to the Zoölogical Gardens, and he enjoyed looking at all the animals
which were like those that he knew, such as deer, antelope, etc.,
and all the birds, even the ostriches, but was much alarmed at the
various larger animals in cages. He often said afterwards that he
wished to go again, but not to see ‘beasts in houses’; and we could in
no manner account for this fear. May we not suspect that the vague
but very real fears of children, which are quite independent of experience,
are the inherited effects of real dangers and abject superstitions
during ancient savage times? It is quite conformable with what we
know of the transmission of formerly well-developed characters, that
they should appear at an early period of life, and afterwards disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pleasurable Sensations.</span>&mdash;It may be presumed that infants feel
pleasure whilst sucking, and the expression of their swimming eyes
seem to show that this is the case. This infant smiled when 45
days, a second infant when 46 days old; and these were true smiles
indicative of pleasure, for their eyes brightened and eyelids slightly
closed. The smiles arose chiefly when looking at their mother and
were therefore probably of mental origin; but this infant often smiled
then, and for some time afterwards, from some inward pleasurable
feeling, for nothing was happening which could have in any way excited
or amused him. When 110 days old he was exceedingly amused by a
pinafore being thrown over his face and then suddenly withdrawn; and
so he was when I suddenly uncovered my own face and approached
his. He then uttered a little noise which was an incipient laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Here surprise was the chief cause of the amusement, as is the case
to a large extent with the wit of grown-up persons. I believe that
for three or four weeks before the time when he was amused by a face
being suddenly uncovered, he received a little pinch on his nose and
cheeks as a good joke. I was at first surprised at humor being appreciated
by an infant only a little above three months old, but we should
remember how very early puppies and kittens begin to play. When
four months old, he showed in an unmistakable manner that he liked
to hear the pianoforte played; so that here apparently was the earliest
sign of an æsthetic feeling, unless the attraction of bright colors, which
was exhibited much earlier, may be so considered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Affection.</span>&mdash;This probably arose very early in life, if we may
judge by his smiling at those who had charge of him when under two
months old; though I had no distinct evidence of his distinguishing
and recognizing any one, until he was nearly four months old. When
nearly five months old he plainly showed his wish to go to his nurse.
But he did not spontaneously exhibit affection by overt acts until a
little above a year old, namely, by kissing several times his nurse who
had been absent for a short time. With respect to the allied feeling of
sympathy, this was clearly shown at six months and eleven days by his
melancholy face, with the corners of his mouth well depressed, when his
nurse pretended to cry. Jealousy was plainly exhibited when I fondled
a large doll, and when I weighed his infant sister, he being then
fifteen and one half months old. Seeing how strong a feeling jealousy
is in dogs, it would probably be exhibited by infants at an earlier age
than that just specified, if they were tried in a fitting manner.</p>

<p><i>Association of Ideas, Reason, Etc.</i>&mdash;The first action which exhibited,
as far as I observed, a kind of practical reasoning, has already
been noticed, namely, the slipping his hand down my finger so as to
get the end of it into his mouth; and this happened on the 114th day.
When four and a half months old, he repeatedly smiled at my image and
his own in a mirror, and no doubt mistook them for real objects; but
he showed sense in being evidently surprised at my voice coming from
behind him. Like all infants, he much enjoyed thus looking at himself,
and in less than two months perfectly understood that it was an
image; for if I made quite silently any old grimace, he would suddenly
turn round to look at me. He was, however, puzzled at the age of
seven months, when being out of doors he saw me on the inside of a
large plate-glass window, and seemed in doubt whether or not it was
an image. Another of my infants, a little girl, when exactly a year
old, was not nearly so acute, and seemed perplexed at the image of a
person in a mirror approaching her from behind. The higher apes
which I tried with a small looking-glass behaved differently; they
placed their hands behind the glass, and in doing so showed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
sense, but far from taking pleasure in looking at themselves, they
got angry and would look no more.</p>

<p>When five months old, associated ideas arising independently of any
instruction became fixed in his mind; thus as soon as his hat and cloak
were put on, he was very cross if he was not immediately taken out of
doors. When exactly seven months old, he made the great step of
associating his nurse with her name, so that if I called it out he would
look round for her. Another infant used to amuse himself by shaking
his head laterally; we praised and imitated him, saying, “Shake your
head;” and when he was seven months old, he would sometimes do
so on being told without any other guide. During the next four
months the former infant associated many things and actions with
words; thus when asked for a kiss he would protrude his lips and keep
still&mdash;would shake his head and say in a scolding voice, “Ah,” to the
coal-box or a little spilt water, etc., which he had been taught to consider
as dirty. I may add that when a few days under nine months
old, he associated his own name with his image in the looking-glass,
and when called by name would turn towards the glass, even when at
some distance from it. When a few days over nine months, he learned
spontaneously that a hand or other object causing a shadow to fall on
the wall in front of him was to be looked for behind. Whilst under a
year old, it was sufficient to repeat two or three times at intervals any
short sentence to fix firmly in his mind some associated idea. In the
infant described by M. Taine, the age at which ideas readily became
associated seems to have been considerably later, unless, indeed, the
earlier cases were overlooked. The facility with which associated ideas
due to instruction and others spontaneously arising were acquired,
seemed to me by far the most strongly marked of all the distinctions
between the mind of an infant and that of the cleverest full-grown
dog that I have ever known. What a contrast does the mind of
an infant present to that of the pike, described by Professor <span class="locked">Mobius,<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a></span>
who, during three whole months dashed and stunned himself against
a glass partition which separated him from some minnows; and when,
after at last learning that he could not attack them with impunity,
he was placed in the aquarium with these same minnows, then in a
persistent and senseless manner he would not attack them!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_I" id="Footnote_I" href="#FNanchor_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> ‘Die Bewegungen der Thiere,’ etc., 1878, p. 11.</p></div>

<p>Curiosity, as M. Taine remarks, is displayed at an early age by
infants, and is highly important in the development of their minds; but
I made no special observation on this head. Imitation likewise comes
into play. When our infant was only four months old, I thought
that he tried to imitate sounds; but I may have deceived myself, for
I was not thoroughly convinced that he did so until he was ten months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
old. At the age of eleven and a half months, he could readily imitate
all sorts of actions, such as shaking his head and saying “Ah” to any
dirty object, or by carefully and slowly putting his forefinger in the
middle of the palm of his other hand, to the childish rhyme of “Pat
it and pat it and mark it with T.” It was amusing to behold his
pleased expression after successfully performing any such accomplishment.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it is worth mentioning, as showing something
about the strength of memory in a young child, that this one,
when three years and twenty-three days old, on being shown an engraving
of his grandfather, whom he had not seen for exactly six
months, instantly recognized him and mentioned a whole string of
events which had occurred whilst visiting him, and which certainly
had never been mentioned in the interval.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moral Sense.</span>&mdash;The first sign of moral sense was noticed at the age
of nearly thirteen months; I said, “Doddy (his nickname) won’t give
poor papa a kiss,&mdash;naughty Doddy.” These words, without doubt, made
him feel slightly uncomfortable; and at last, when I had returned to
my chair, he protruded his lips as a sign that he was ready to kiss me;
and he then shook his hand in an angry manner until I came and received
his kiss. Nearly the same little scene recurred in a few days,
and the reconciliation seemed to give him so much satisfaction that
several times afterwards he pretended to be angry and slapped me, and
then insisted on giving me a kiss. So that here we have a touch of the
dramatic art, which is so strongly pronounced in most young children.
About this time it became easy to work on his feelings and make him
do whatever was wanted. When two years and three months old, he
gave his last bit of gingerbread to his little sister, and then cried out
with high self-approbation, “Oh, kind Doddy, kind Doddy.” Two
months later he became extremely sensitive to ridicule, and was so
suspicious that he often thought people who were laughing and talking
together were laughing at him. A little later (two years and seven and a
half months old) I met him coming out of the dining-room with his
eyes unnaturally bright, and an odd, unnatural or affected manner, so
that I went into the room to see who was there, and found that he had
been taking pounded sugar, which he had been told not to do. As he
had never been in any way punished, his odd manner certainly was not
due to fear, and I suppose it was pleasurable excitement struggling
with conscience. A fortnight afterwards I met him coming out of the
same room, and he was eyeing his pinafore, which he had carefully
rolled up; and again his manner was so odd that I determined to
see what was within his pinafore, notwithstanding that he said there
was nothing, and repeatedly commanded me to “go away,” and I found
it stained with pickle-juice; so that here was carefully planned deceit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
As this child was educated solely by working on his good feelings, he
soon became as truthful, open and tender as any one could desire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Unconsciousness, Shyness.</span>&mdash;No one can have attended to very
young children without being struck at the unabashed manner in which
they fixedly stare without blinking their eyes at a new face; an old person
can look in this manner only at an animal or inanimate object.
This, I believe, is the result of young children not thinking in the least
about themselves, and therefore not being in the least shy, though they
are sometimes afraid of strangers. I saw the first symptom of shyness
in my child when nearly two years and three months old; this was
shown towards myself, after an absence of ten days from home, chiefly
by his eyes being kept slightly averted from mine; but he soon came
and sat on my knee and kissed me, and all trace of shyness disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Means of Communication.</span>&mdash;The noise of crying or rather of
squalling, as no tears are shed for a long time, is of course uttered in an
instinctive manner, but serves to show that there is suffering. After
a time the sound differs according to the cause, such as hunger or
pain. This was noticed when this infant was eleven weeks old, and I
believe at an earlier age in another infant. Moreover, he appeared
soon to learn to begin crying voluntarily, or to wrinkle his face in the
manner proper to the occasion, so as to show that he wanted something.
When 46 days old, he first made little noises without
any meaning to please himself, and these soon became varied. An
incipient laugh was observed on the 113th day, but much earlier in
another infant. At this date I thought, as already remarked, that he
began to try to imitate sounds, as he certainly did at a considerably
later period. When five and a half months old, he uttered an articulate
sound “da,” but without any meaning attached to it. When a
little over a year old, he used gestures to explain his wishes; to give a
simple instance, he picked up a bit of paper, and, giving it to me,
pointed to the fire, as he had often seen and liked to see paper burnt.
At exactly the age of a year, he made the great step of inventing a word
for food, namely, <i>mum</i>, but what led him to it I did not discover.
And now, instead of beginning to cry when he was hungry, he used this
word in a demonstrative manner or as a verb, implying “Give me food.”
This word, therefore, corresponds with <i>ham</i>, as used by M. Taine’s
infant at the later age of fourteen months. But he also used <i>mum</i>
as a substantive of wide signification; thus he called sugar <i>shu-mum</i>,
and a little later after he had learned the word ‘black,’ he called
liquorice <i>black-shu-mum</i>&mdash;black-sugar-food.</p>

<p>I was particularly struck with the fact that when asking for food
by the word <i>mum</i> he gave to it (I will copy the words written down
at the time), “a most strongly marked interrogatory sound at the end.”
He also gave to “Ah,” which he chiefly used at first when recognizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
any person or his own image in a mirror, an exclamatory sound, such
as we employ when surprised. I remark in my notes that the use of
these intonations seemed to have arisen instinctively, and I regret that
more observations were not made on this subject. I record, however,
in my notes that at a rather later period, when between eighteen and
twenty-one months old, he modulated his voice in refusing peremptorily
to do anything by a defiant whine, so as to express, “That I won’t;” and
again his humph of assent expressed, “Yes, to be sure.” M. Taine also
insists strongly on the highly expressive tones of the sounds made by
his infant before she had learned to speak. The interrogatory sound
which my child gave to the word <i>mum</i> when asking for food is especially
curious; for, if any one will use a single word or a short sentence
in this manner, he will find that the musical pitch of his voice rises
considerably at the close. I did not then see that this fact bears on
the view which I have elsewhere maintained that before man used
articulate language, he uttered notes in a true musical scale, as does
the anthropoid ape Hylobates.</p>

<p>Finally, the wants of an infant are at first made intelligible by instinctive
cries, which after a time are modified in part unconsciously,
and in part, as I believe, voluntarily as a means of communication,&mdash;by
the unconscious expression of the features&mdash;by gestures and in a
marked manner by different intonations,&mdash;lastly by words of general
nature invented by himself, then of a more precise nature imitated
from those which he hears; and these are acquired at a wonderfully
quick rate. An infant understands to a certain extent, and as I believe,
at a very early period, the meaning or feeling of those who tend
him, by the expression of their features. There can hardly be a doubt
about this with respect to smiling; and it seemed to me that the infant
whose biography I have here given understood a compassionate expression
at a little over five months old. When six months and eleven
days old, he certainly showed sympathy with his nurse on her pretending
to cry. When pleased after performing some new accomplishment,
being then almost a year old, he evidently studied the expression of
those around him. It was probably due to differences of expression
and not merely of the form of the features that certain faces clearly
pleased him much more than others, even at so early an age as a little
over six months. Before he was a year old, he understood intonations
and gestures, as well as several words and short sentences. He understood
one word, namely, his nurse’s name, exactly five months before he
invented his first word, <i>mum</i>; and this is what might have been expected,
as we know that the lower animals easily learn to understand
spoken words.</p>

<h3><i>COMPARATIVE LONGEVITY AND
GREATNESS.</i></h3>

<p>Whether or not great men are favored
by an increase of years above
those allotted to more ordinary mortals
has long been a question of interest,
and has acquired a special importance
in connection with the study of
the natural history of men of genius,
and the discussions of the possible relation
of greatness to degeneracy and
to insanity. Questions of this type can
only be decided on the basis of extensive
and carefully collected data, which unfortunately
it is difficult and at times
impossible to collect or to find. It is
therefore natural that such evidence as
seems to exist and to carry with it some
degree of logical force should be brought
forward in proof of a claim which on
general principles is both pleasing and
plausible. Of this type is the problem
of the relation between longevity and
greatness, and of this type is the evidence
now and then brought forward
to substantiate the belief that great
men are, as regards longevity, an unusually
favored class.</p>

<p>The most recent presentation of the
topic (by Mr. Thayer in the Forum, February,
1900) collects a list of some five
hundred prominent men and women of
the nineteenth century and finds that
these persons lived on an average
sixty-eight years and eight months;
that is, nearly thirty years longer
than the population as a whole. And
on the basis of this conclusion the
writer combats the notion that nineteenth-century
men of genius or of
eminence exhibit signs of degeneracy,
because longevity and the ability to do
sustained work for a large number of
years is in itself a sign of unusual vitality
and vigor. As these conclusions are
apt to be extensively quoted, and as
they seem to me founded upon a serious
fallacy, I shall attempt to present as
simply as possible the nature of the
desired evidence which alone could
prove that great men are longer lived
than others, and to show that the evidence
thus far presented is inadequate
to support the conclusion which has
been drawn. Mr. Thayer is not the
first one to present the average age at
death of a number of eminent persons
as evidence of unusual longevity. In
an article which was reprinted in the
Popular Science Monthly for May, 1884,
the average age at death of 1,741
astronomers was given, and found to be
sixty-four years and three months; and
on the basis of this fact the author
claimed that astronomers enjoyed unusual
longevity. In a brief contribution
published in Science, October 1,
1886 (and republished in Nature, November
4, 1886), I called attention to
the fallacy inherent in such conclusions,
and also presented some new contributions
to the question of the longevity of
great men. The materials of that
article I shall utilize in the present discussion.</p>

<p>To reach the kernel of the matter at
once, the reader must note that the
fallacy consists in neglecting to consider
that in dealing with astronomers
or with great men, or with persons of
eminence of the nineteenth century, one
is dealing with a group which is already
carefully selected, <i>and the selection of
which inevitably involves the attainment
of a certain age</i>. The result is
that we are not dealing with average
persons as regards longevity, but with
persons who in the very nature of
things have already reached a certain
period of maturity. No one can become
a poet, or a novelist, or a painter,
or a philosopher, or a commander or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
statesman unless he lives at least a sufficient
number of years to acquire the
development of an adult, and to have
the opportunity of developing his abilities
and distinguishing himself. If
great men were great from their infancy,
and if we had the means of ascertaining
this fact, then, and only then,
would the method used be correct.</p>

<p>It is ordinarily stated that the average
duration of life is somewhere between
thirty-three and forty years, and
Mr. Thayer considers that in the present
century it has moved forward towards
the latter figure. What this
means is that if we were to keep a
record of the age at death of all Americans
who are to be born within the
first ten years of the coming century,
we should find that their average age
at death would be some thirty odd
years. But this number can by no
means be used as a standard with which
to compare the average age at death of
men of distinction, or indeed of any
other class of men selected according
to a standard which involves on their
part the attainment of mature years.
If we were investigating the longevity
of twins, or of persons with supernumerary
toes, or indeed of persons possessing
any quality which one could detect
in new-born infants, and if we
could determine the average life-period
of this class of persons and find that
it markedly exceeded the average of
the entire community, we should be entitled
to conclude that twins, or persons
who have supernumerary toes, are
blessed with a greater longevity than
the average man. But so long as men
who are to acquire distinction bear no
traces upon them of this power until
they exhibit their powers and actually
gain distinction, it is obvious that we
are concerned with their longevity only
from that moment when they have
entered, or have become promising candidates
for that class of selected individuals
whose longevity we are investigating.
Proceeding on this basis, I tried
to determine the age at which, on the
average, men of genius had accomplished
a work sufficient to entitle them
to be so denominated. This investigation
was instigated by Mr. C.&nbsp;S. Peirce,
then in charge of courses in logic at the
Johns Hopkins University. Under his
leadership a small company, of whom I
was one, proposed to study certain
traits of great men, and for this purpose
we tried to select the three hundred
greatest men of all times. The work
was never carried on to completion, so
that the final selection of the names,
and particularly their use in the present
connection, must rest on my sole responsibility.
I mention these facts
mainly to indicate the general representative
character of the list which I
used. I take from my previously published
article the following essential
facts: Omitting all doubtful names,
about two hundred and fifty names remain,
presenting a list which most persons
would agree to be fairly representative
of the greatest men of all times. Of
these again I selected <i>at random</i> those
about whom it was easiest to fix the
age at which they had done work which
would entitle them to a place on this
list, or work which almost inevitably
led to such distinction. It is a date about
midway between the first important
work and the greatest work. The average
of over sixty such ages is thirty-seven
years; which means that, on the
average, a man must be thirty-seven
years old in order to be a candidate for
a place on this list. The real question,
then, is, How does the longevity of this
select class of thirty-seven-year-old men
compare with that of more ordinary individuals?
The answer is given by the
expectation of life at thirty-seven years,
which is twenty-nine years, making the
average age at death sixty-six years.
And this is precisely the age at death
of these sixty great men; showing that,
as a class (for these sixty may be considered
a fair sample) great men are
not distinguished by longevity from
other men.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that my own
conclusion is entirely opposed to that
of Mr. Thayer. But this opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
rests not upon a difference of data, but
upon a difference of logic. To my mind
the enumeration of ages at death of any
number of great men cannot prove unusual
longevity unless we take into
consideration and can determine the
number of years which, on the average,
a person must have lived in order to
become a candidate for the class under
consideration. The comparison with
the average age (that is, the period of
about thirty-five or more years) is not
only false; it is essentially absurd; for
it would become possible only if we had
among poets, and painters, and musicians,
and historians, and scientists, and
generals a goodly number who succumbed
to the diseases of early infancy,
or to some of the ills that juvenile flesh
is heir to.</p>

<p>It may be well to illustrate at this
point just what conclusions may be
drawn from the data which Mr. Thayer
and other writers have presented. The
first conclusion is that it takes a considerable
length of time to become eminent&mdash;on
the whole a very natural and comprehensible
statement. And with regard
to the astronomers previously mentioned
it is even possible to go farther;
for these astronomers have been divided
into four degrees of eminence, and
it is found that astronomers of the first
rank are longer-lived than those of the
second, and these in turn are longer-lived
than those of the third class, and
these in turn are longer-lived than
those of the fourth class. Therefore,
the author concludes, the greatest astronomers
have been most favored with
length of years, and adds, as practical
advice, “Be an astronomer and live
long.” Now, of course, the true conclusion
is that it takes longer to accomplish
work which will entitle one
to pre-eminence amongst astronomers
than to do work which will only
achieve moderate distinction. And the
practical conclusion would read, “Live
long enough to become great as an astronomer
and you will probably, with
the ordinary expectation of life, have
a good chance of completing your three
score and ten.” In the same way Mr.
Thayer’s list of nineteenth-century
celebrities might fairly be said to suggest
the conclusion that in the present
century one must already have labored
for a goodly number of years before
one’s name would be selected by a student
of the longevity of great men. So
far, then, these facts have an interesting
interpretation.</p>

<p>It may also be worth while to note
that if all the men whose longevity is
to be compared are of a comparable
class (that is, comparable with regard
to the attainment of years which they
assume), then the longevity of different
groups of celebrities may be compared
with one another. Thus it is possible to
compare the longevity of musicians
with that of scientists (of about equal
eminence), and according to Mr.
Thayer’s lists the scientists lived ten
years longer than the musicians. The
same conclusion appears in my own
study, in which the scientists appear
amongst the longest-lived, and the
musicians amongst the shortest-lived
men of genius. This conclusion must
not be pressed too far, but in a general
way it certainly is a bit of evidence
worthy of consideration as proving
that distinguished scientists live
longer than distinguished musicians. It
would be wrong to draw rigid conclusions
from comparisons of small groups,
and therefore it is better to contrast
the average age at death of the various
men studied in as large and as general
classes as possible; e. g., as men of
thought, men of feeling and men of action.
All of the studies with which I
am acquainted point to the conclusion
that men of thought live longer than
those who achieve distinction through
unusual qualities of their emotional natures.</p>

<p>We may now approach the question,
whether or not it is possible to prove
that the men of distinction of the nineteenth
century are longer-lived or shorter-lived
than their every-day contemporaries.
It would be possible to do this
had we statistics of the age at death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the various professions; and again, had
we these deaths classed according to the
distinction which the individuals attained.
In addition to this it would
be necessary to ascertain (with some
rough approximation, as I have attempted
to do with regard to the greatest
men of all times) the age at which
they had accomplished sufficient work
to entitle them to be enrolled in their
special class. To take concrete instances,
let us suppose that we wish to
investigate the longevity of American
lawyers. Now to be a lawyer in name
only requires the candidate to have
lived twenty-one years, and the average
number of years which the average person
of twenty-one years of age will continue
to live is about forty; so that the
mere fact that a man is a lawyer would
bring his average age at death up to
sixty-one years. I find in Mulhall’s
Dictionary of Statistics the statement
made that the lawyers of Frankfurt die
at the average age of fifty-four years,
while merchants live to be fifty-seven
years old. I know nothing about the
authority of these figures, and am using
them for illustration only. Assuming
all the data to be correct (and twenty-one
seems not too high an age for this
purpose), this would seem to suggest
that the ordinary lawyer of Frankfurt
is not favored with abundance of years.
In passing, it is interesting to note that
these Frankfurt statistics of lawyers
and merchants and other classes show
a uniformly lower age at death than
those of the more eminent representatives
of their professions. This is just
what we should expect; for to be included
in the one group one must have
lived only long enough to prepare and
establish one’s self as a lawyer or as a
merchant; while for the other group
one must in addition have had opportunity
to cultivate one’s ability to a
riper fruitage, and in a keen, and often
long competition gain public recognition.
It thus follows that the average
longevity of the most distinguished lawyers
will be greater than that of ordinary
lawyers, because it takes longer to
enter the more select class. But this
argument, like many others, should not
be pressed too far; innate ability may
accomplish in a brief period what for
more moderate powers is the work of
many years. Nonetheless, in the study
of comparative longevity it is the average
that is significant; and it is the
fluctuation of the average that we aim
to discover. Thus, in the investigation
of the longevity of an unwholesome occupation,
such as would be accepted by
a life insurance company only at special
rates, we should expect to find the age
at death of such individuals less than
that of other classes involving an equal
period of apprenticeship; but, of course,
not less than that of the ‘population as
a whole.’ And, to continue with the
main argument, if we wish to investigate
the longevity of shoemakers we
should again have to decide upon some
age at which on the average a person
has probably already acquired the dexterity
requisite to be a shoemaker.
Even if we fix this so low as ten years,
at which time the expectation of life
is forty-eight years, it would bring the
average age at death of shoemakers to
fifty-eight years. It has thus become
extremely obvious that if we compared
these ages at death with the average
life-period it would be just as easy to
prove that lawyers and shoemakers and
merchants enjoy exceptional longevity,
as to prove that great men do. The average
longevity is low because of the very
large infant mortality, which enters into
the composition of this average. When
once the first ten years of life are passed
the further expectation of life increases
quite slowly. Roughly speaking, for
every ten years between ten and fifty
years the added expectation of life is
but three years for each decade. We
therefore see that in the very nature
of things no one class of adults can possibly
live as much as thirty years
longer than ‘the population as a
whole.’ The differences with which we
are dealing are differences of a finer
order, of a small number of years, and
being slight differences, must be substantiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
by a relatively large number
of cases; the cases, moreover, must be
collected in a wholly unobjectionable
manner; that is, in a manner in which
the principle of selection bears no influence
upon the longevity. To my
knowledge adequate statistics which exhibit
the relative longevity of different
classes do not exist, and they certainly
do not exist with regard to great men.
We may therefore conclude that the
facts which have thus far been collected
are not opposed to the conclusion
that great men enjoy favorable
longevity, but they certainly have not
established or contributed to the establishment
of this fact. While it is
not impossible to collect material which
may serve as corroborative evidence of
the longevity of great men, it seems
probable that we must be content with
evidence of a far inferior character.</p>

<p>Although I regard Mr. Thayer’s
argument concerning longevity as entirely
fallacious, I find myself in sympathy
with his main contention. It
seems to me that much of the evidence
which has been brought forward to assimilate
greatness with degeneracy is of
questionable value and that the logical
force of such evidence has been very
much overrated. That genius and insanity
are related is probably capable
not of demonstration, but of a moderate
degree of substantiation; but this evidence
must be both judiciously collected
and judiciously interpreted. It
cannot be presented in a popular form
without subjecting it to the danger of
serious and harmful misrepresentation.
In the same way the question of degeneracy
and its bearing upon modern life
has been frequently misstated, so that
statements of protests such as Mr.
Thayer offers are both opportune and
likely to have a wholesome effect. But
the present concern is only with the relation
of longevity to greatness as an
indication of the absence of degeneracy.
That long life is inconsistent with a general
degeneracy may be admitted; but
that great men exhibit this quality to
any unusual degree has certainly not
been proven.</p>

<h3><i>SCHOOL REFORM.</i></h3>

<p>School teachers and educational reformers
undoubtedly take themselves
and their ideas too seriously. Accordingly
one rejoices to see an eminent man
put his own affairs aside for a moment
and discuss educational theories in a
humorous vein. Even ridicule should
be welcomed if it can relieve the sombre
earnestness of the educational platform
and press. Professor Münsterberg, in
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for May, has done
pedagogy this service by subjecting the
elective system and professional training
for high-school teachers to considerable
good-natured ridicule. His article
is so readable that one is led to suppose
that it was written to be read, not to be
believed. Moreover, Professor Münsterberg’s
eminence as a psychologist should
not be taken as a sign that he thinks he
knows aught of education. He has himself
warned us against the illusion that
psychology can derive truth about
teaching, or that the psychologist can
inform the teacher or anything of value.
It may be that the wholesome matters
of fact, as well as the brilliant imaginative
criticism of this article are only
play. The very strenuousness of the
teacher’s nature, however, will probably
lead him to try to extract some new
gospel of reform from Professor Münsterberg’s
lightest pleasantry; consequently
it seems wise to consider the
article as a serious argument and provide
a possible antidote for it.</p>

<p>Professor Münsterberg contends that
it is unwise to give high-school teachers
special professional education apart
from knowledge of the subjects which
they are to teach; that it is folly to replace
a prescribed course of study by an
elective system; that the salvation of
our schools depends upon the scholarship
of the teachers and the attitude of
parents. As the reformers agree heartily
with this last claim (unless it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
made an exclusive aim), and as its
meaning is so vague that almost anything
can be urged as a corrolary to it,
it may be dismissed. The first two contentions
are about concrete matters of
educational practice which need to be
thought over. If professional preparation
is a waste of time, there is every
reason why we should omit it; if a prescribed
course of study is better for the
boys and girls, we can conscientiously
lessen the expense and labor of administration
in many schools.</p>

<p>The argument on the first point is,
briefly, that Professor Münsterberg’s
teachers were good teachers and that
they had no notion of even the vocabulary
of educational theories. But obviously
that may not have been the
secret of their success. A majority of
the high-school teachers in New England
have had no professional training,
yet no one has observed that they are
superior to those of their class who
have. The argument is really a bare
assertion of an unverified guess. It is
the hap-hazard opinion of an eminent
psychologist who perchance is trying to
furnish evidence of his previous theory
that psychology does not give one
knowledge about teaching. It is worth
while to note here a certain interesting
aspect of human nature. Training in
one sphere of intellectual activity need
not bring ability in other spheres. The
habit and power of observation or reasoning
acquired in connection with
chemistry need not make a man a good
observer or reasoner in politics or philology.
So we should not be surprised
that a man eminent for his scientific
habits as a psychologist should, on a
question in another field, offer imaginative
hypotheses without an attempt to
verify them, or to collect pertinent evidence
or to eliminate factors outside
those he discusses. We may be allowed
to feel sorry. If a scientist wishes to
really clear up the question of the value
of professional training, why does he
not find representatives of the classes,
‘teachers with professional training’ and
‘teachers their equals in other respects,
who have replaced the effort after professional
training by equal effort after
further scholarship,’ and compare the
work of the two classes? If other factors
enter to disturb such an investigation,
why not carefully look at the facts
to ascertain their influence? Until he
does so his dicta will stand as mere
opinions. It would be a blessing if
scientific men would use the weight of
their reputations, not to bolster up their
after-dinner opinions about things in
general, but to teach the public scientific
methods of studying them.</p>

<p>Apart from the danger of offering
pedagogy an unproved opinion as a fact,
it seems poor economy to leave a question
in such shape that only the opinion
of another eminent man on the opposite
side is required to destroy the result
you have attained. Precisely this has
occurred in the case of Professor Münsterberg’s
contributions to educational
discussion two years ago. Another eminent
man, Professor Dewey, has recently
squarely denied what Professor Münsterberg
affirmed. It only remains for
some equally eminent German professor
to rise and declare that his teachers
were bad and that they had no professional
training, or that his teachers
were good and had it, and Professor
Münsterberg’s effect is neutralized.</p>

<p>Professor Münsterberg’s argument
against the elective system is more
complex. He regards the elective system
as partly a concession to the obvious
need of fitting young people
earlier for their occupations in life and
partly an attempt to use the likes and
dislikes of children as a guide to what
is good for them. This is a very narrow
view. The elective system has been in
part the result of the progress of science
and the consequent conviction that the
scientific study of things and human affairs
should be a part of one’s education.
The elective system furnished a
compromise by which such studies
found a place in the college and school
curricula. If the student is left to
choose among them, instead of having a
new prescribed course made out on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
basis of modern views of life’s needs,
it is partly because they are more easily
introduced and retained as electives and
partly because there is no agreement as
to which studies will be the best to prescribe.</p>

<p>The idea that reformers desire to
have a course containing studies good
for children and studies not good for
them and to trust the scholars’ likes
and dislikes to guide them to the former,
is absurd. Whether they are right
in assuming that what is best for one
boy may not be best for another, that
his teachers and parents can help him
to pick out a course of study better for
him than any inflexible course prescribed
for all can be, is a question of importance,
but one which Professor Münsterberg
does not try to answer. Instead,
he tells us about his gratitude
to his parents and teachers for never letting
him neglect his steady toil at prescribed
Greek for the pursuits which he
himself elected out of school, such as
electrical engineering, botany, novel-writing,
reading Arabic, writing books
on the prehistoric anthropology of West
Prussia, etc., etc. Now, this confession
about his early life absolves us from
paying any further attention to his experience
as a lesson to our high-school
youths. The youth Münsterberg and
the average high-school student do not
belong in the same class. For he was
evidently an eminent boy as he is an
eminent man. We must admit, however,
that the rigorous discipline afforded
by the prescribed Latin and
Greek is evidenced in the present stern
moral sense of the professor, who is willing
to abandon his chosen and favorite
pursuit, laboratory experimentation,
and at the call of duty give himself to
the hated but necessary tasks of writing
philosophical disquisitions, political discussions
and articles on school reform.</p>

<h2 title="Scientific Literature" id="scientific">SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.</h2>

<h3><i>CHEMISTRY.</i></h3>

<p>The general interest which has been
aroused the last few years in physical
chemistry is reflected in the number of
books which have appeared in this department.
Some of these dwell more
upon the older physical chemistry, devoting
but relatively little space to the
later developments, while others are
chiefly concerned with the newer phases
of the subject. Perhaps the most satisfactory
book which has appeared along
this line is Walker’s ‘Introduction to
Physical Chemistry’ (Macmillan). No
attempt is made to exhaust the field
but the subject is well covered. Especially
commendable is the clearness of
the book, which will render it useful to
students. The non-mathematical treatment
of the subject will also commend
it to many who use it as an introduction
to physical chemistry. A book of
narrower scope is Dr. H.&nbsp;C. Jones’s
‘Theory of Electrolytic Dissociation and
Some of Its Applications,’ from the press
of the same publishers. The author
gives first a short review of the development
of physical chemistry up to the
days of van’t Hoff, and then surveys
the origin of the theory of electrolytic
dissociation, its proofs and some of its
applications. While making no pretense
to cover the whole field of physical
chemistry, the author furnishes a very
readable account of the most important
of the later generalizations. It is a
book which should be read especially by
those chemists and physicists who are
working in other fields, that they may
gain a fair view of the electrolytic dissociation
theory written by one thoroughly
competent for his task. Biologists,
too, will find the latter part of the
book, treating of the applications of the
theory to animal and plant life, of especial
interest. Dr. Jones, with S.&nbsp;H.
King, has also translated Biltz on ‘Practical
Methods of Determining Molecular
Weights.’ This is a successful attempt to
gather together the best of the different
methods of real value, and it is very
satisfactorily carried out, presenting a
good guide book for students.</p>

<p>In the production of text-books of
general chemistry, there seems to be a
little lull, very few books having appeared
in recent months. The first part
of what promises to be a somewhat original
work on inorganic chemistry, by
Dr. Sperber, has appeared. After the
introduction on general chemical laws,
the elements of the seventh group (chlorine,
etc.), are first considered, and then
their hydrogen compounds; the sixth
group (oxygen, etc.) and its hydrogen
compounds; fifth group (nitrogen, etc.),
etc. The method used is purely inductive,
each subject being introduced by
experiments from which the underlying
principles are developed.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A third edition of Elliott and Ferguson’s
‘Qualitative Analysis’ has appeared
which is a considerable improvement
upon the previous editions. The principal
merit of this book, is in the opinion
of many its greatest drawback. In
clearness and minuteness of directions
it is hardly equalled by any manual of
qualitative analysis, and thus it is a
particularly easy book for the instructor
to use, especially with a large class. But
this, on the other hand, cannot fail to
encourage mere mechanical work on the
part of the student and to discourage independence.
With large classes, however,
it is a difficult problem how best
to cultivate individuality of work.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A little manual of ‘Analysis of White
Paints,’ by G.&nbsp;H. Ellis, will prove of
value to chemists to whom now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
then paint samples are brought for
analysis. It is a collection of notes by
a chemist who has had much experience
along this line.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In the field of applied chemistry quite
a number of books have come out lately,
the most useful of which is probably the
seventh volume of ‘The Mineral Industry.’
The field of mineral resources and industries
of the world is very thoroughly surveyed,
and the volume is brought as
closely down to date as possible. In this
respect it has a great advantage over
the corresponding publication of the
United States Government. Among the
subjects which are treated very thoroughly
in the present volume are calcium
carbid, fire brick and paving brick,
coal mining methods and their economic
bearing, progress in the metallurgy of
copper and of gold, notes on the progress
of iron and steel metallurgy (by
Henry M. Howe), sulfuric acid, progress
in ore dressing (by Robert H. Richards).
It is a book necessary to the teacher,
of great value to the economist and of
much interest to the general reader.
The second edition of McMillan’s ‘Electro-metallurgy’
is a considerable improvement
on the former edition, and is
brought well down to date. The greater
part of the book is devoted to the electro-deposition
of metals, and is thorough
and satisfactory. It is, however, unfortunate
that the treatment of electro-metallurgical
ore-extraction should be
very inadequate, this whole subject, together
with electro-refining, being confined
to a single chapter of thirty pages.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Lange’s ‘Chemische-technische Untersuchungsmethoden’
is passing through
its fourth edition, of which the second
volume is just out. This treats of metals
and metallic salts, fertilizers, fodders,
explosives, matches, gas manufacture,
ammonia and coal tar and inorganic
colors. The book aims at exhaustive
treatment, and while some subjects are
in parts weak, as is naturally the case
where there are many different authors,
it is as a whole the best work in its
field.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A book in a new line is H. and H.
Ingle’s Chemistry of Fire and Fire Prevention’
(Spon and Chamberlain). The
book takes its origin from lectures delivered
to an audience of insurance men.
After three chapters on the history and
theory of combustion, various industries
more or less connected with fire are
taken up; coal gas, dust explosions, fuel,
illuminants, explosives, oils, volatile
solvents, paints and varnish making,
textile manufactures, spontaneous combustion,
are some of the subjects treated.
The last chapter is a quite useful one
on fire prevention and extinction. The
book contains much useful information
and should prove of very considerable
value outside of the rather limited audience
to which it is addressed.</p>

<h3><i>ZOOLOGY.</i></h3>

<p>The past few months have witnessed
the publication of many important
works on zoölogical subjects, and among
these it may not be amiss to note first
Kingsley’s ‘Text-Book of Vertebrate
Zoölogy,’ since it adopts a new method,
that of showing the bearing of embryology
upon the morphology of vertebrates,
and in turn, of morphology upon their
classification. Its object is stated to be to
“supplement both lectures and laboratory
work, and to place in concise form
the more important facts and generalizations
concerning the vertebrates,” and
the author has succeeded in crowding a
large amount of information into the
439 pages of the work. The illustrations
are numerous, and for the most part
very good, comprising some figures that
have appeared in other text-books and
some that are the outcome of Dr. Kingsley’s
own work. It is to be noted that
in place of many of the standard European
forms that have done morphological
duty for years, we have such American
types as Acanthias, Necturus, Amblystoma
and Sceloporus, a change for
which we are duly grateful.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Parker and Haswell’s admirable
‘Manual of Zoölogy’ has been revised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
and adapted for the use of American
schools and colleges. It aims to give
an outline of the structure and morphology
of certain typical members
of the various classes of animals and
also briefly discusses such zoölogical
questions as evolution, descent and distribution.
An ‘Elementary Course of
Practical Zoölogy,’ by T.&nbsp;J. Parker and
W.&nbsp;N. Parker, has been issued somewhat
on the lines of Huxley and Martin’s
‘Biology,’ aiming to give a rather detailed
account of the structure of a few
types instead of glancing at the animal
kingdom as a whole.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Books on birds, and especially those
devoted to the popularizing of ornithology,
continue to be numerous, and
among them may be mentioned Keeler’s
‘Bird Notes Afield,’ which introduces us
in a pleasant way to the better-known
birds of California, a subject of which
Mr. Keeler is well qualified to treat.
Less attractive from a literary standpoint,
but more important from a practical
point of view, is Lange’s ‘Our Native
Birds: How to Protect Them and Attract
Them to Our Homes,’ which discusses
the various causes for the decrease
of birds, and suggests methods by which
this may be prevented. Of a totally different
character is Shelley’s ‘Birds of
Africa,’ now in process of publication,
the first part of Vol. II having recently
appeared. While many undescribed
forms may be expected from Africa in
the future, this work brings the subject
down to date. ‘The Birds of South Africa’
are described in one compact volume
by Arthur C. Stark, and the Australian
Museum is now issuing a new edition
of ‘A Catalogue of Nests and Eggs of the
Birds of Australia,’ by Alfred J. North,
the original having long been out of
print. It is to be hoped that the first
volume of the new hand-list of birds,
‘Nomenclator Avium tum fossilium tum
viventium,’ by R. Bowdler Sharpe, which
was published last fall, may soon be followed
by others, as the completed list
will be a boon to all working ornithologists.
Finally, it may not be known to
all our readers that last year Newton’s
‘Dictionary of Birds’ was issued in one
volume at a reduced price.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The second and final part of ‘Insects,’
of the Cambridge Natural History, by
David Sharp, gives us one of the most
important, if not <i>the</i> most important
work on entomology that has appeared
for a long time, the two volumes forming
a condensed encyclopædia of entomology
that will be needed by all working
entomologists. Another useful work
on entomology is Carpenter’s ‘Insects,
Their Structure and Life,’ that portion
devoted to the ‘life’ of insects being the
best, particularly the chapter on ‘Insects
and Their Surroundings.’ Of a
strictly popular nature is Scudder’s
‘Every-day Butterflies,’ which deals in a
charming way with some sixty species
of eastern North America.</p>

<h3><i>BOTANY.</i></h3>

<p>The beginning of the year has been
marked by the appearance of the usual
number of elementary and popular
books dealing with some phase of botany.
Among these Professor Barnes’s
‘Outline of Plant Life’ (H. Holt &amp; Co.)
is a simplified edition of a high school
text of a year earlier. Only the gross
anatomy of the plant is considered and
the ordinary routine of beginning with
the simpler forms and advancing to
ones of successively more complex structure
is followed, and the principles of reproduction
and physiology are presented.
The student is given an insight
into the adaptive processes of the
plant by a study of the special forms
which live in the water, dry soil, deserts,
and other special conditions.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>‘Lessons in Botany,’ by Professor Atkinson
(H. Holt &amp; Co.) is a similar edition
of a high school text designed to
meet the needs of students in half-year
courses. The student is led to an interest
in the plant by a consideration of
seedlings and buds, then launched in
a course dealing with types of varying
morphological constitution with attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
to physiology and morphology.
The taxonomy of some of the more important
families of seed plants is discussed
in a special section. The author
pays tribute to the present leaning toward
ecology by chapters on seed distribution,
the struggle for the occupancy
of land, zonal distribution, soil formation
in rocky regions and moors, plant
communities, and adaptations of plants
to climate.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In ‘Nature and Work of Plants’
(Macmillan) Dr. MacDougal approaches
the subject of botany by a study of the
functions of the plant, of the things
which it must do to live and adapt itself
to its surroundings. Such an introduction
to the subject from the physiological
point of view is a radical innovation
in the matter of elementary
texts. A second departure from the
practice of current texts is the omission
of illustrations, in order that the attention
of the student may not be distracted
from the plant at work by a
picture of something it has done. The
technique is simple and the book seems
well-fitted to awaken enthusiastic interest
and lead the student further into
the subject. Chapters are devoted to
such subjects as: composition and purposes
of plants, the manner in which
the different kinds of work are divided
among the members of the body, the
way in which new plants arise, and the
relations of plants to each other.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Miss Alice Lounsberry’s ‘Guide to
the Trees’ (Stokes &amp; Co.) is an example
of a type of popular books in botany indispensable
to the amateur, and of great
value to the working botanist. Nearly
two hundred species, including shrubs,
have been described. “Among them
are all those most prominent in northeastern
America, and a few distinctive
or rare species from the South and
West. Several also that are not indigenous
but which have become identified
with the tree life of this country
are presented.” The author has grouped
forms of similar habit together in such
manner that sections are devoted to:
Trees preferring to grow in moist soil,
lowlands and meadows; trees preferring
to grow near water, in swamps, and
running streams; trees preferring to
grow in rich soil, in forests and thickets,
and trees preferring to grow in light,
dry soil and upland places. The general
notes of information appended to the
technical descriptions add much to the
reading value of the book, which is beautifully
illustrated by sixty-four colored
plates, after paintings by Mrs. Rowan,
and a hundred sketches in black and
white.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The amount of interest centered in
the preservation of the forests of the
national domain, and the establishment
of forestry in the courses of several
educational institutions, makes Mr.
Bruncken’s ‘North American Forests
and Forestry’ (Putnam &amp; Sons) most
timely. The author discusses the sociological
aspects of forestry, and the distribution
of forests in North America.
It is of interest to note that the forest
is treated as a living plant formation
subject to many vicissitudes in the
struggle for existence with neighboring
societies of plants, particularly with the
bog and prairie. The fate of the forest
in front of the advancing pioneer is well
delineated, and forest finance management
and protection are most sensibly
considered. Perhaps no other work offers
the citizen such a rational presentation
of all aspects of the numerous
questions involved in forestry as the
one under discussion.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Sachs’s ‘Physiology of Plants’ has
long been a classic among botanists because
of the immense amount of new results
which were brought out in its
pages, marking the dawn of a new epoch
in the history of botanical investigation.
A large share of its conclusions have
become invalidated by the general advance
of the subject, however, and the
next most notable work, Pfeffer’s ‘Plant
Physiology,’ is one which is bound to
exert even a more lasting influence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the guidance and furtherance of research.
The first volume issued, dealing
with the metabolism and sources
of energy in plants, is cyclopedic in
its completeness of review of investigations
in this phase of the physiology
without cumbering its bibliographical
lists with titles of unimportant papers.
In general, subjects yet under controversy
are set forth with judicial fairness,
and the author has made himself
familiar with the work of Russian,
English and American botanists in a
manner not practiced by some of his
contemporaries. The translation of this
work by Dr. Ewart (Clarendon Press)
has given opportunity for the correction
of any slight omissions in the bibliography,
and the completed book must be
regarded as of the greatest value not
only to the botanist but to the animal
physiologist who would cover the domain
of that illusive subject known as
“general physiology.”</p>

<h3><i>ANTHROPOLOGY.</i></h3>

<p>Probably the most striking sign of
the increasing interest in the study of
primitive man is the organization of
well-equipped expeditions for the investigation
of prehistoric remains and particular
groups of existing savages. Of
the latter class, the Cambridge expedition
to Torres Straits, under the leadership
of Professor A.&nbsp;C. Haddon, has returned
to England, and various preliminary
reports of the results of its work
have already appeared. A new departure
in the scheme of work of this expedition
was the introduction of psychological
observations under experimental
conditions among the natives.
The tests which were made were necessarily
simple, but covered a fairly
wide field. They included tests of visual
acuteness, color vision and color
blindness, acuteness and range of hearing,
appreciation of tones and differences
of rhythm, tactile acuteness and
localization, estimation of weights, simple
reaction-times to visual and auditory
stimuli, estimation of intervals of
time, memory and a number of tests of
a more general character.</p>

<p>The detailed results have not yet appeared,
but it is evident that there is
much of interest to be expected. For
example, of about two hundred and
fifty individuals of different tribes
tested for color blindness, not a case
was found, except on one island, where
three out of eight subjects suffered from
ordinary red-green blindness. Reaction-times
are said to be shorter than among
the uneducated classes of European peoples,
but no figures have as yet appeared.
A fact, important if true, is
the reported lack of suggestibility
among the natives of the region. This
is directly opposed to the general observations
of most ethnographers and
seems hardly probable. On all points
the detailed reports are needed.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>On this side of the world public attention
has been called particularly to
the admirable plans of the Jesup North
Pacific Expedition, which has been at
work for the past three years on the
northwest coast of America and the
opposite coast of Asia. During the year
just past the first published accounts of
its results have begun to appear in a
series of handsome monographs from
the American Museum of Natural History
in New York. Professor Franz
Boas, the director of the expedition,
furnishes the first two memoirs, one on
‘Facial Paintings of the Indians of
British Columbia’ and the other on the
‘Mythology of the Bella Coola Indians.’
The first named is of importance because
of its bearing on the evolution of
decorative designs. The Indians of the
northwest coast differ from most other
primitive groups in the matter of decoration
by their failure to develop geometric
designs and their tendency to retain
realistic portrayals with certain
characteristic modifications. In the
adaptation of the decorations to the
human face the problem has been difficult
and a large number of examples
are given showing the method of solution.
The memoir on Bella Coola mythology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
is the first account of the complex
conceptions of these Indians which
can lay any claim to completeness. The
Bella Coola conception of the universe is
interesting. They believe in five worlds,
one above the other, of which the middle
one is the earth. Above this are
spanned two heavens and beneath, two
underworlds. In the upper heaven resides
the supreme deity, who interferes
little with the affairs of men; in the
lower heaven dwell the Sun and all the
other deities who are more intimately
connected with mankind. The first underworld
is inhabited by ghosts who
may rise to the first heaven and be sent
again to earth, and in the second underworld
dwell the ghosts of those who
have died a second death; from this
there is no return. Other memoirs in
the series are ‘The Archæology of Lytton,
B.&nbsp;C.,’ by Harlan I. Smith, descriptive
of the work of the expedition
in that line; ‘The Thompson Indians of
British Columbia,’ by James Teit, which
is an exhaustive ethnographical account
of that tribe, and ‘The Basketry Designs
of the Salish Indians,’ by Livingston
Farrand, in which is shown the development
of geometric designs from realistic
forms among the Indians of the Salish
stock, a development which contrasts
sharply with that of the neighboring
stocks described by Boas.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>With the results of field-work pouring
in and the constant modifications of
theory brought about thereby, it becomes
a task practically impossible to
write a general ‘Anthropology’ which
will not be out-of-date before it issues
from the press. Nevertheless, from time
to time the attempt is made and one
of the latest ventures is ‘Man, Past and
Present,’ by Mr. A.&nbsp;H. Keane (University
Press, Cambridge). It is a general
classification and description of the
races of man which is open to the same
objections as to validity of classification
as can be offered to any work on the
subject at the present stage of knowledge.
At the same time it contains
much information in compact form, is
not technical and will doubtless be useful.
Of similar scope is ‘The Races of
Man,’ by J. Deniker, which has just appeared
in English form (Scribner’s Contemp.
Sci. Series). This work, also compact,
is somewhat more technical than
Keane’s and also more accurate. It contains
an appendix, with brief tables of
measurements and indices adapted for
quick reference.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Of more special studies, unquestionably
the most important work of the
year is Messrs. Spencer and Gillen’s ‘The
Native Tribes of Central Australia’
(Macmillan). This extraordinarily minute
account of the customs of the tribes
with which it deals has already begun
to attract the attention which it deserves.
The problems upon which it
throws light are numerous, but probably
that of most general interest is
Totemism, with its many social and religious
bearings. The origin of this
well-known savage custom has been a
puzzle and heretofore not even a plausible
suggestion has been made toward
its solution. Messrs. Spencer and Gillen’s
account of the totemic ceremonies
of the Arunta tribe, however, points irresistibly
toward a definite economic
origin, an attempt to preserve and increase
the totemic animals and objects
for the good of the tribe. The underlying
relation between the clansman and
his totem, as well as the social relations
between the members of a clan, with the
rules regarding marriage and the resultant
modification of the family organization,
are all analyzed with quite exceptional
skill and in this and other
fields the book is destined to become a
classic.</p>

<h2 title="The Progress of Science" id="progress">THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE.</h2>

<p>Dr. Wolcott Gibbs presented his
resignation from the presidency of the
National Academy of Sciences at the recent
Washington meeting, and the occasion
permits the publication of his portrait
and a few words in reference to his
great contributions to science. Born in
New York City in 1822, Dr. Gibbs graduated
from Columbia College fifty-nine
years ago. He studied abroad under
Liebig, the founder of the first chemical
laboratory, occupied a chair in the College
of the City of New York, and was
for twenty-four years Rumford professor
at Harvard University. He became
professor emeritus in 1887, and
established a private laboratory at
Newport, where he has continued his researches.
Dr. Gibbs is one of the great
chemists of the world. He is the only
American honorary member of the German
Chemical Society. Among other
important ideas, his suggestion that the
electrolytic deposition of copper be used
as a means of quantitative analysis is
one which has grown to a remarkable
extent. There are now a number of volumes
devoted solely to the amplification
of this idea, which has been applied
to numerous substances. Many
other methods of quantitative analysis
have been improved and simplified under
his guidance, but perhaps his greatest
work is his extended experimental
study of complex salts, especially the
cobaltamine compounds, and a great
number of singularly complicated
bodies, containing some of the rarer
elements. Most of these substances are
of no practical value, but they are of
great theoretical interest, because they
are only partially explained by the
present theories of molecular structure.
While the resignation of Dr. Gibbs from
the presidency of the Academy is doubly
regretted because it is owing to the fact
that his health no longer permits the
strain of the office, chemical science will
profit all the more from his exclusive
devotion to research.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The meetings of the National Academy
of Sciences held annually at Washington
during the third week of April,
pass without the general attention that
they deserve. For the Academy meets
not only to listen to special scientific
papers, but also as the official scientific
adviser of the Government. As knowledge
increases in range and exactness,
it is evident that expert advice becomes
more and more necessary, both for the
enactment of legislation and for carrying
it into effect. It may, indeed, be
fairly claimed that the advisory or expert
department of the Government
should rank coördinate with its legislative,
executive and judicial branches.
The National Academy has on occasion
been called to investigate scientific questions&mdash;thus
it has recently presented a
report to the Department of the Interior
on a policy for the forested lands of the
United States&mdash;but it has been of less
service in this direction than was intended
by the act of incorporation or
than sound policy dictates. This limitation
to the usefulness of the Academy
seems to depend in part on the small
membership, and the fact that it consists
of the most eminent rather than
the most efficient men of science of the
country. The Academy has less than
one hundred members, only one fourth
as many as the Royal Society. Professor
Jastrow shows in the present
number of this journal that men of
science do not become eminent until
rather late in life, and the members of
the Academy are apt to be somewhat
lacking in initiative. University professors
are now selected chiefly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
younger men of promise, who are expected
not only to attain scientific eminence,
but also to possess executive ability
and to exert personal influence. The
National Academy needs a membership
of this character, and has fortunately
to some extent obtained it within recent
years. Thus the members elected at the
present meeting are Prof. James E.
Keeler, director of the Lick Observatory;
Prof. Franz Boas, of Columbia
University and the American Museum of
Natural History; Prof. Henry F. Osborn,
also of Columbia University and the
American Museum, and Prof. Samuel
L. Penfield, of Yale University.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There is perhaps no objection to regarding
the National Academy of
Sciences as a <i>quasi</i> hereditary upper
house, whose functions are largely conservative,
while the active duties on
behalf of science devolve on a more
democratic body&mdash;The American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
This association meets at Columbia University,
New York City, during the last
week of the present month, and with it
some fifteen special societies devoted to
different sciences. The association celebrated
its fiftieth anniversary in Boston
two years ago, when about half of
its nearly two thousand members were
present, and there is every reason to
hope that the New York meeting will
be as largely attended. The members
will be welcomed by Governor Roosevelt
and President Low, and after listening
to addresses by the vice-presidents,
will divide into nine sections, before
which special papers will be presented.
The address of the retiring president,
Mr. G.&nbsp;K. Gilbert, of the United States
Geological Survey, will be given at the
American Museum of Natural History
on Tuesday evening, while the president,
Prof. R.&nbsp;S. Woodward, of Columbia University,
will preside at the general sessions.
The American Association has
during its long history performed a useful
service in bringing men of science
together and in attracting the attention
of the general public to scientific work,
but in some respects it has been less influential
than its sister associations in
Great Britain, Germany and France. This
has been in some measure due to the
large area of the country and the heat of
the summer, making it difficult for men
of science to come together, but it probably
represents chiefly a certain lack of
organization of science in America.
With the growth of university centers
and of scientific work under the Government,
the number of men of science has
greatly increased, while with the establishment
of special societies and journals
their means of intercommunication have
improved. There is every reason for the
support of an association which can represent
the whole body of scientific men
and forward the scientific movements
that are of such importance to the country.
The membership of the association
is of two classes, fellows and members.
The former are selected from those who
are actively engaged in advancing
science, while all those who are interested
in science are eligible for membership.
Those who would like to have
their names proposed for membership
may address the local secretary of the
New York meeting, Prof. J. McKeen
Cattell, Columbia University, or the permanent
secretary, Dr. L.&nbsp;O. Howard,

<p>A very ambitious project is on the
stocks for the foundation of an ‘International
Association for the Advancement
of Science, Arts and Education.’
It will be remembered that there was
last year an interchange of visits between
the British Association meeting at
Dover and the French Association meeting
at Boulogne. Arrangements were
then made resulting in the appointment
of general committees for Great Britain
and France, and it was decided to hold
an international assembly at Paris during
the Exposition. Prof. Patrick Geddes,
secretary of the British Group, has
since visited the United States, and a
general committee has been formed with
Dr. W.&nbsp;T. Harris, United States Commissioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of Education, and Prof. R.&nbsp;S.
Woodward, president-elect of the American
Association, as vice-presidents. M.
Bourgeois, late French Minister of Education,
is the general president, and M.
Gréard, rector of the University of
Paris, is president of the French Group.
The plans for the Assembly this summer
are based directly on the Paris Exposition.
It is proposed to establish
headquarters on the grounds of the Exposition,
in the buildings of the University
of Paris and at other places, where
those interested in the scientific aspects
of the Exposition and in the scientific
and educational congresses may meet
and receive information and guidance.
Special visits to the Exposition and
other excursions, special lectures and
entertainments, special summaries of the
work of the congresses, etc., are promised.
The Association is not, however,
limited to the Paris Exposition, but proposes
a permanent organization for the
holding of assemblies and the organization
of relations between men of science
of different nations. Those interested in
the Paris Assembly may secure further
information from Mr. Ely, secretary of
the American Group, 23 East Forty-fourth
street, New York City.</p>

<p>The Government of the United States
does more to develop the resources of
the country and advance science than
any other nation. On these objects the
sum of over $8,000,000 is spent annually
and over 5,000 officers are employed.
Yet in one direction it has fallen far behind
the great European nations. Our
Department of Agriculture, our Geological
Survey and many other agencies
surpass in range and efficiency the similar
institutions elsewhere, but the applications
of physics and chemistry to
the arts have not enjoyed equal advantages.
The Physikalische-Technische
Reichsanstalt, the national physical
laboratory of the German Empire, established
under the direction of von
Helmholtz, is conducted at an annual
cost of $80,000, and there is in addition
a German bureau of weights and measures
on which the sum of $36,000 is annually
expended. For similar purposes
Great Britain spends annually $62,000,
Austria, $46,000, and Russia, $17,500,
whereas, our office of Standard Weights
and Measures receives the meager appropriation
of $10,400. We are very glad
to learn that the Secretary of the Treasury
has submitted an amendment to the
pending sundry civil bill, creating in
place of the present office a National
Standardizing Bureau. According to the
amendment the functions of the bureau
shall consist in the custody of the standards;
the comparison of the standards
used in scientific investigations, engineering,
manufacturing, commerce and
educational institutions with the standards
adopted or recognized by the Government;
the construction when necessary
of standards, their multiples and
subdivisions; the testing and calibration
of standard measuring apparatus; the
solution of problems which arise in connection
with standards; the determination
of physical constants and the properties
of materials when such data are
of great importance to scientific or manufacturing
interests and are not to be
obtained of sufficient accuracy elsewhere.
Provision is also made for the
erection of a laboratory and its equipment,
and for the employment of an
adequate staff, with a director, whose
salary shall be $6,000 per annum.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is satisfactory that the Secretary
of the Treasury should recommend a
reasonable salary for the director of the
proposed bureau. Men of science are, as
a rule, but poorly paid, and the officers
in the scientific departments of the Government
receive in many cases salaries
that are a small part of what they could
earn as physicians or lawyers. There is,
of course, danger that if salaries are
large, the offices will be sought by ‘practical’
politicians, and it is probably the
part of wisdom to offer the best facilities
for research rather than large salaries.
Still, if the scientific man has
the salary of a clerk, he will be ranked
in the same class by legislators and executive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
officers. The small salaries offered
at Washington also lead to the
continual loss of those whose services
are of the greatest value to the Government.
Thus, the recent call to the presidency
of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology of Dr. Henry S. Pritchett,
Superintendent of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey, is a serious
blow to the bureau and to science at
Washington. Dr. Pritchett’s scientific
attainments and executive ability will
find ample scope at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where he
worthily succeeds Presidents Rogers,
Runkle, Walker and Crafts. But he was
also greatly needed in the Coast and
Geodetic Survey, where, after the excellent
administration of Dr. T.&nbsp;C. Mendenhall,
there had been an unfortunate
interregnum of three years. During the
past three years, however, the work of
the Survey has been placed on an excellent
basis by Dr. Pritchett, and there
is every reason to believe that the
ground gained will not be lost.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The transition of Dr. Pritchett from
the professorship of mathematics and astronomy
in Washington University to
the superintendency of the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey and
now to the presidency of the Massachusetts
Institute, calls attention to the
fact that the only promotion possible to
men of science or university professors
is an executive position. The type of
the German <i>Gelehrte</i>, still current in literature
and on the stage, is not common
in America. The modern methods of
advancing science&mdash;the laboratory, the
observatory, the museum, the expedition,
with their complex equipment&mdash;demand
administrative ability of a high
order. Science has been able to supply
presidents, not only to the great technical
schools, but also to Harvard, Johns
Hopkins, Stanford and other universities.
Still, it is unfortunate that the
man of science can not look forward to
promotion in the direction of his own
work. He becomes a college professor
or the like at a comparatively early age
with a moderate salary. He has now as
a motive the increase of his reputation,
rather likely to degenerate into vanity,
and the nobler motive of contributing to
the advance of science and of civilization.
But these motives appeal differently
to different men&mdash;in any case,
they bake no bread and educate no
children. The average salary of scientific
men can not be greatly increased;
there must be a certain relation between
supply and demand, and the average
earnings of other professional men are
also small. But the lawyer may look
forward to becoming a judge, the physician
to a large city practice, the
clergyman to a bishopric, etc. In Germany
a university professor may look
forward to being called to Berlin, to becoming
a <i>Hofrat</i>, a <i>Geheimrat</i> and a
‘von.’ It seems that we need in each
American university one or two chairs
with very large endowments, the occupation
of which would be a special
honor.</p>

<p>The French Academy of Sciences
and French Science have lost two of
their most distinguished representatives
in the deaths of Joseph Bertrand and
of Alphonse Milne-Edwards. Bertrand
was born in 1823, and was somewhat of
a prodigy when a boy, having published
a paper on the theory of electricity
when but sixteen years old, and being
the author of numerous mathematical
papers before he was twenty-one. His
original contributions to mathematics
and mathematical physics are of great
importance, and he was the author of
standard works on algebra, on arithmetic
and on the calculus. As permanent
secretary of the Paris Academy of
Sciences he was continually engaged in
administrative work, preparing obituary
notices, acting as judge in the annual
awards of its prizes, etc. He also contributed
a large number of biographies
and other articles to non-technical journals.
Milne-Edwards, born in 1835, was
a son of the eminent zoölogist, Henri
Milne-Edwards, and the grandson of
Bryan Edwards, the historian and member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
of the British Parliament. Milne-Edwards
published important researches
in paleontology and in zoölogy, especially
in relation to birds, and was at
the time of his death professor of zoölogy
at Paris and director of the Jardin
des Plantes.</p>

<p>In the deaths of the Duke of Argyll
and Prof. St. George Mivart, Great Britain
loses two men of a type more common
there than in the United States.
Argyll was a man of great wealth,
whose interests in science were only secondary,
but who did much directly and
indirectly for its advancement. His
work, ‘The Reign of Law,’ published
some twenty-five years ago, has been
widely read, and he is the author of
many books and articles concerned with
the natural sciences. Mivart, although
trained as a barrister, became perhaps
a professional man of science, but he
never occupied a regular university position.
He published numerous contributions
to comparative anatomy and zoölogy,
but is perhaps best known for
books and articles on general scientific
subjects. Just before his death, it will
be remembered, he was excommunicated
from the Roman Catholic Church owing
to articles which were supposed not to
be in conformity with its tenets. Both
Argyll and Mivart represented an attitude
towards the doctrine of evolution
which may be regarded as now practically
extinct.</p>

<p>Two lectures have been recently delivered
by Prof. James Dewar at the
Royal Institution on the subject of
liquid and solid hydrogen. These lectures
have been illustrated by experiments
and have attracted the attention
of the most distinguished chemists and
physicists of England. It is easy to understand
such interest in the subject
when we consider that even Clerk Maxwell
thought it improbable that hydrogen
would ever be liquified, and yet
Dewar was able to exhibit not only
liquid, but solid, hydrogen to his audience.
Briefly recapitulated, the steps in
the condensation of what were formerly
called the permanent gases are these: in
1878 Cailletet, in Paris, and Pictet, at
Geneva, by suddenly expanding gases
which had been compressed to a high
degree and cooled to a low temperature,
succeeded in obtaining these gases in the
shape of a mist or of a transitory liquid
jet. In 1884 Wroblewski and Olszewski
at Crakow obtained oxygen and nitrogen
as static liquids. By expanding
hydrogen from a compression of 190 atmospheres
in a vessel cooled by liquid
air evaporating under diminished pressure,
this gas was obtained as a mist
or momentary froth, though it was affirmed
by Olszewski that he observed
the liquid hydrogen in colorless drops
and as a liquid running down the sides
of the tube. In May, 1898, Dewar obtained
hydrogen as a static liquid by allowing
compressed hydrogen, cooled in
a bath of boiling air, to escape rapidly
at a jet, the liquid hydrogen being collected
in a doubly isolated vacuum vessel.
This liquid hydrogen is a colorless
liquid, with a specific gravity of 0.07
or less than one sixth the weight of
liquid marsh gas, the lightest liquid
hitherto known. This is better realized
by saying that while one gram of water
has the volume of one cubic centimeter,
one gram of liquid hydrogen has a volume
of over 14 c. c. The boiling point
of hydrogen is -252° C. or 21° above
the absolute zero, and by boiling in a
vacuum the temperature of 15° can be
obtained. Very recently by slowly
evaporating very perfectly isolated
liquid hydrogen, solid hydrogen was obtained
by Dewar as a white mass of
solidified form, of the lowest temperature
ever obtained, -258° C.</p>

<p>Among the most suggestive results
obtained through recent work in experimental
embryology are those of Prof.
Jacques Loeb, of the University of Chicago,
on the chemical fertilization of the
eggs of sea-urchins without participation
of the male element. There has for
some time been reason to suspect that
cell-division, both in tissue cells and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the egg, is incited by chemical stimulus;
and several observers before Loeb had
shown that when unfertilized sea-urchin
eggs are treated by the addition
to the sea-water of various substances,
such as strychnine or chlorides of
sodium or magnesium, they may undergo
some of the preliminary changes of
development and may even segment.
Loeb was able to induce complete and
normal development by first bringing
the eggs for about two hours into a mixture
of sea-water and a weak solution
of magnesium chloride, and then transferring
them to normal sea-water. Eggs
thus treated segmented and underwent
a development which, though somewhat
slower than usual, was otherwise normal
and produced perfect larvæ. This
effect can not properly be called fertilization
in the ordinary sense of the word,
but is rather to be regarded as artificially
induced parthenogenesis. It points
unmistakably, however, to the possibility,
or rather probability, that in normal
fertilization the spermatozoon incites
the egg to development by bringing
to it certain definite chemical substances;
and Loeb gives reasons for the
view that these substances are probably
in the form of ions, concluding that
these and not the nucleins are essential
to the process of fertilization. A highly
suggestive new field for work is opened
by these experiments.</p>

<p>Astronomers can not bring the phenomena
they study into the laboratory
or test the behavior of the heavenly
bodies under artificial conditions. They
have to be satisfied with such opportunities
as nature gives, even though
she bestows them as meagerly as she
does solar eclipses. Consequently, the
total eclipse of the forenoon of May 28th
has been the object of much preparation.
Most of the important astronomical observatories
in this country will have
parties stationed along the path of the
eclipse from New Orleans to Norfolk,
Va. Many European parties will observe
the eclipse in Portugal, Spain and
North Africa. It has been pointed out
by Prof. R.&nbsp;W. Wood and Mr. A.&nbsp;L.
<span class="locked">Rotch<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a></span> that there are several important
physical observations to be made apart
from the astronomical observations on
the sun’s corona described by Professor
Bigelow, in the May number of this
magazine. Just before and after totality
alternate bright and dark bands are observed
sweeping across the country. It
is hoped that by the coöperation of a
number of observers more complete and
exact data concerning this phenomena
may be gathered and its explanation
found. The changes in the wind noted
during eclipses will also be observed to
ascertain whether the sudden cooling of
the atmosphere by the passage of the
moon’s shadow is a sufficient explanation
of the so-called ‘eclipse wind.’
Those who know nothing about theories
of the corona or of the ‘eclipse wind’
will be interested in the more obvious
phenomena and in some cases, in the opportunity
to take such a photograph as
can not be duplicated in this country
until 1918. The most favored ones are
those who live in the fifty-mile belt of
the total eclipse, but the sun will be
seen nine tenths covered in the eastern
and southern States, and will be six
tenths covered to those in the least favorable
locality of the United States,
the extreme northwest. The proper
methods of observing and photographing
the corona were described in Professor
Bigelow’s article on the eclipse in the
May number of the <span class="smcap">Popular Science
Monthly</span>.</p>
